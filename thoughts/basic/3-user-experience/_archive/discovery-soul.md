# Discovery Soul

*The whole experience in one page.*

## The Room

Twilight blue. Warm, not sterile. The leather chaise, not the hospital bed.

You know it's a system. The system holds you anyway.

Like a tarot reading — the reader unfolds what they see.

---

## The Flow

**1. Scenarios** — Buttons. Fast. Recognition, not confession.
**2. Follow-ups** — "What's underneath that?"
**3. Reflection** — Pattern + anti-pattern + vision + trade-off.

## Scenario Examples

> **6pm. Boss texts for 7pm call. You had dinner with Sarah.**
> - Cancel on Sarah
> - Say yes, keep it short (you won't)
> - "Tomorrow morning?"
> - Pretend you didn't see it

> **Gym bag by the door. 6:30am. Bed is warm.**
> - Get up, hate it until I arrive
> - "I'll go after work" (I won't)
> - Snooze, feel bad all day
> - "5 min" on phone → 7:15

> **Hard conversation you've been avoiding.**
> - Wait for right moment (never comes)
> - Rehearse 50 times, still don't do it
> - Hint, hope they bring it up
> - Have it. Hard. Done.

## Follow-Up Questions

Not who-what-when-where-why. Go for the heart.

- What's the sentence you're afraid to say?
- What's underneath that?
- Did you know you were doing that?
- What would you have to accept if it doesn't work?
- So you're trading X for Y. Did you know?

## The Dimensions

| Extract | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Pattern** | What you actually do |
| **Anti-pattern** | What you wish you did |
| **Vision** | What you're moving toward |
| **Anti-vision** | What you're running from |
| **Trade-off** | What you're sacrificing (knowingly or not) |

---

## The Reflection

> **The pattern:** You say yes to work and resent it.
>
> **The anti-pattern:** You want protected time, but you won't protect it.
>
> **The vision:** Freedom. Something that's yours.
>
> **The anti-vision:** Still stuck in three years. Still planning.
>
> **The trade-off:** You're trying to excel everywhere. Something has to give.

---

## The Voice

TARS. 90% honesty, 75% humor.

Calm. Curious. Wry. Never performing.

> "You've said 'I should' four times. At some point 'should' becomes 'will.' No rush."

---

## The Contract

- **Objective:** Clear. Measurable.
- **Trade-offs:** Named. Logged.
- **The Spark:** One action. 15 min. Now.
