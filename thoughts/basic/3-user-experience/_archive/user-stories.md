## Epic: Discovery Flow

### Landing & Entry

**US-01: First Impression**
> As a skeptical person who's tried self-help before,
> I want to see something that feels different from the usual apps,
> so I'm curious enough to continue.

Acceptance:
- Dark, warm visual tone (not clinical white)
- Copy that names my state ("Stop Spinning")
- Single CTA, no overwhelming options

---

**US-02: Frictionless Start**
> As someone who hates creating accounts,
> I want to enter just my email and get started,
> so I don't abandon before I even begin.

Acceptance:
- Magic link auth, no password
- Email → link → session in <30 seconds
- Resume from where I left off if I return

---

### Scenarios

**US-03: Recognizable Moments**
> As someone who struggles to articulate my problems,
> I want to see real scenarios I recognize,
> so I can just pick the one that's me instead of explaining.

Acceptance:
- Scenarios are specific moments, not abstractions
- "6pm, boss texts, you had plans" — not "Someone asks for your time"
- Options capture the honest responses (including the self-aware bad ones)

---

**US-04: Pattern Recognition**
> As I answer scenarios,
> I want each choice to reveal something about my patterns,
> so the system builds understanding from what I DO, not what I SAY.

Acceptance:
- Each scenario maps to dimensions (pattern/anti-pattern, approach/avoid, etc.)
- Profile builds silently across choices
- No scoring visible to user

---

### Follow-Up Conversations

**US-05: Deeper Questions**
> After I pick a scenario option,
> I want TARS to ask a question that goes deeper,
> so I understand what's underneath my choice.

Acceptance:
- "What's the sentence you're afraid to say?"
- "What would you have to accept if it doesn't work?"
- Not: "Tell me about a specific time"

---

**US-06: Being Seen**
> As TARS reflects back what I said,
> I want to feel recognized, not analyzed,
> so this feels like a conversation, not an assessment.

Acceptance:
- Reflection uses my actual words
- Tone is curious, not diagnostic
- Pacing allows me to sit with what was said

---

### Reflection

**US-07: Pattern + Anti-Pattern**
> After the scenarios and conversations,
> I want to see my pattern AND what I actually want,
> so the gap between them becomes visible.

Acceptance:
- "The pattern: You say yes and resent it."
- "The anti-pattern: You want protected time."
- Both named without judgment

---

**US-08: Vision + Anti-Vision**
> I want to see what I'm moving toward AND what I'm running from,
> so I understand the stakes.

Acceptance:
- Vision: "Freedom. Something that's yours."
- Anti-vision: "Still stuck in three years. Still planning."

---

### Trade-offs

**US-09: Forced Choice**
> When my desires conflict,
> I want TARS to name the tension and ask me to choose,
> so I stop oscillating and commit.

Acceptance:
- "You want both. You can't have both. Which one?"
- Clear consequences for each choice
- Choice is logged and can't be undone by tomorrow's doubt

---

### Contract

**US-10: The Output**
> At the end,
> I want a clear contract with my objective, trade-offs, and constraints,
> so I have something to hold myself to.

Acceptance:
- Objective: Clear. Measurable.
- Trade-offs: Named. Logged.
- Constraints: My real situation, not excuses.

---

**US-11: The Spark**
> I want one immediate action I can do in <15 minutes,
> so I break inertia while I'm still here.

Acceptance:
- Specific (not "think about it")
- Doable now (no dependencies)
- Connected to the first milestone

---

## Epic: TARS Voice

**US-12: Honest but Warm**
> Throughout the experience,
> I want TARS to be honest without being harsh,
> so I feel held, not judged.

Acceptance:
- 90% honesty, 75% humor (Interstellar TARS)
- "You've said 'I should' four times. At some point 'should' becomes 'will.'"
- Never performative ("That's amazing! 🎉")

---

**US-13: Wry Recognition**
> When TARS notices a pattern,
> I want the observation to land with recognition, not accusation,
> so I laugh instead of defend.

Acceptance:
- "That's interesting. Not wrong — interesting."
- Occasional dry wit
- Never lectures
