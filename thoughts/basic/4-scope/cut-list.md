# Cut List

**Section:** 4-scope
**Status:** Draft
**Purpose:** Explicitly document what we're NOT building and why

---

## Cut from MVP

Features that were considered for MVP but explicitly excluded.

### The Walk (Experiments & Journeys)

**Why considered:** Core transformation mechanism
**Why cut:** Must validate Mirror first; Walk is meaningless if nobody completes 7 days
**When returns:** Phase 2

---

### Star Animations

**Why considered:** Visual polish, "alive" feeling
**Why cut:** Static stars test the core hypothesis (do patterns resonate?)
**When returns:** Phase 1 (if feedback demands it)

---

### Push Notifications

**Why considered:** Experiment reminders, return nudges
**Why cut:** No experiments in MVP; adds complexity
**When returns:** Phase 2 with Walk

---

### Native Mobile Apps

**Why considered:** Better UX, always-with-you
**Why cut:** PWA is sufficient for validation; native is expensive
**When returns:** Phase 3+ if retention proves out

---

### Context Graph Predictions

**Why considered:** Core moat, personalization
**Why cut:** Requires data accumulation over weeks; MVP is 7 days
**When returns:** Phase 3 after sufficient data

---

### Social Sharing

**Why considered:** Viral growth, identity validation
**Why cut:** Core experience must work first
**When returns:** Phase 1 (Birth Chart sharing)

---

### Email Summaries

**Why considered:** Retention, return hooks
**Why cut:** Adds integration complexity; not core to hypothesis
**When returns:** Phase 3

---

### Multi-Device Sync Indicators

**Why considered:** "Continue where you left off" clarity
**Why cut:** Convex handles sync invisibly; explicit UI not needed
**When returns:** Only if user feedback demands

---

## Cut Entirely (Not Planned)

Features that exist in ideation but are not on any roadmap.

### Multi-User Mode (Couples, Teams)

**Why in ideation:** Relationship mapping has real value
**Why cut entirely:** Completely different product with different privacy concerns
**Implication:** May spin off as separate product if S.T.A.R.S. succeeds

---

### Champions Marketplace

**Why in ideation:** Platform opportunity, additional revenue
**Why cut entirely:** Platform business is different from product business
**Implication:** Requires PMF + scale first; maybe never

---

### Enterprise Version

**Why in ideation:** B2B revenue potential
**Why cut entirely:** Different buyer, different compliance, different product
**Implication:** Separate business line if pursued

---

### Device Integrations (HealthKit, Calendar, etc.)

**Why in ideation:** Behavioral tracking without self-report
**Why cut entirely:** Adds significant complexity; privacy concerns; self-report works
**Implication:** May reconsider if self-report proves unreliable

---

### Audio/Voice Mode

**Why in ideation:** More natural conversation
**Why cut entirely:** Adds real-time speech processing; text works
**Implication:** Maybe Phase 4+ if text feels limiting

---

### AI-Generated Visual Themes

**Why in ideation:** Personalized constellation aesthetics
**Why cut entirely:** One consistent visual works; personalization is scope creep
**Implication:** Revisit only if users demand

---

## The Cut Philosophy

> "If it doesn't test the hypothesis, cut it."

MVP tests: **Do users complete 7 days of excavation and feel seen?**

Everything else is premature optimization.

---

## Resurrect Conditions

A cut feature should only return if:

1. **User demand:** Pilot users explicitly ask for it
2. **Retention blocker:** Feature absence is causing measurable drop-off
3. **Competitive necessity:** Market forcing function

Never resurrect based on:
- "It would be cool"
- "Competitors have it"
- "We designed it already"
