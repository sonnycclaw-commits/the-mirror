# The Right Questions: Momentum MVP

**Goal**: Break "static inertia" through Goal Decomposition.
**Hook**: "You walked in with a dream. You're walking out with a todo list."

## Core Documentation

### 1. [Momentum Mechanics](./momentum-mechanics.md)
*   **Purpose**: The high-level strategy and philosophy.
*   **Key Concept**: Goal (1 yr) -> Milestone (1 mo) -> Spark (Today).
*   **Change**: No metaphors. Pure physics of action.

### 2. [Decomposition Logic](./decomposition-logic.md)
*   **Purpose**: The "Brain" of the AI Agent.
*   **Content**:
    *   Decision Trees (Idea -> Audience -> Validation).
    *   Prying Protocol (Digging for the *real* bottleneck).
    *   Spark Definitions (<15 min actions).
