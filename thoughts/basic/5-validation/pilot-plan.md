### After Pilot

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Green (targets hit)** | Proceed to Phase 1 (Polish) |
| **Yellow (some signals, some issues)** | Iterate on MVP, run Pilot 2 |

Subject: Your S.T.A.R.S. journey begins

Hi {name},

Thank you for being one of the first to try S.T.A.R.S.

Over the next 7 days, you'll have conversations with TARS—an AI
companion who will help you see patterns you can't see yourself.

Each insight becomes a star. By Day 7, you'll see your full
constellation revealed.

What to expect:
• 5-15 minutes per day
• Personal questions that dig deep
• Your constellation forming in real-time

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Not enough participants | Overrecruit (aim for 20, expect 10-15 active) |
| Drop-off too high | Have buffer users ready |
| Technical issues | Be available for quick support |
| Negative feedback | Document, learn, don't take personally |
| Crisis situation | Have professional resources ready |
