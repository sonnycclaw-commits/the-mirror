# Momentum Mechanics: The Decomposer

> **Purpose**: To break "Static Inertia" by decomposing long-term goals into immediate, actionable momentum.
> **Philosophy**: No metaphors. Just structured decomposition.

---

## 1. The Core Loop

The system takes a **Vague Aspiration** and transforms it into **Concrete Mechanics**.

**Input**: "I want to [Goal]" + "I am stuck because [Reason]"
**Process**: Decomposition Engine acts as a constraint solver.
**Output**: A structured plan that forces movement *today*.

## 2. The Decomposition Hierarchy

We use a standard, proven hierarchy (similar to OKRs) to bridge the gap between "Vision" and "Action".

### Level 1: The Objective (1 Year)
*   **What**: The destination.
*   **Quality**: Clear, measurable, and exciting.
*   **Example**: "Launch a SaaS business generating $1k/MRR."

### Level 2: The Key Results (Milestones)
*   **What**: The proof points along the way.
*   **Mechanism**: Sequential bottlenecks. You cannot do Step 2 until Step 1 is done.
*   **Example**:
    1.  Validate Offer (Month 1)
    2.  Build MVP (Month 2-3)
    3.  First 10 Customers (Month 4)

### Level 3: The Initiatives (Projects)
*   **What**: The actual work packages.
*   **Mechanism**: Time-bound pushes.
*   **Example**: "Run 10 Customer Discovery Interviews."

### Level 4: The Immediate Action (The Spark)
*   **What**: The single smallest action to break static friction *now*.
*   **Mechanism**: Must be doable in <15 minutes.
*   **Example**: "Draft the cold outreach email."

## 4. System Artifacts (The Outputs)

We treat the user's life like a shipping product. The outputs reflect this engineering rigor.

### 1. The Context Profile (The "System Architecture")
*   **What**: The psychometric and situational snapshot.
*   **Analogy**: *System Context Diagram / Legacy Code Documentation*.
*   **Components**:
    *   **Kernel**: Core Values & Drivers.
    *   **Constraints**: Time, Money, Energy (Hardware Limits).
    *   **Tech Debt**: Fears, Bad Habits, Limiting Beliefs.
    *   **Legacy Systems**: Existing commitments/relationships.

### 2. The Momentum Contract (The "PRD")
*   **What**: The definitive plan of action.
*   **Analogy**: *Technical Specification / Release Roadmap*.
*   **Components**:
    *   **Objectives**: The "Product Vision".
    *   **Milestones**: The "Feature Release Schedule".
    *   **Protocols**: The "Standard Operating Procedures" (Diet, Work blocks).
    *   **The Spark**: The "Hotfix" (Immediate action).

### 3. The Decision Log (The "ADRs")
*   **What**: A record of why specific paths were chosen.
*   **Analogy**: *Architecture Decision Records*.
*   **Value**: "We chose [Protocol A] over [Protocol B] because [Constraint X]."
    *   *Why*: Prevents second-guessing. "I agreed to this trade-off."

### 4. The Journey Map
*   **What**: Visual timeline of the "Release Schedule".
*   **Format**: Calendar Export (.ics) + Timeline UI.

## 5. User Psychology (The Physics of Inertia)

We are dismantling the 3 Defenses against Change (Ego Defenses):

1.  **The Fog (Intellectual Alibi)**
    *   *Lie*: "I need more research."
    *   *Counter*: **Radical Specificity** ("Choose A or B now.")

2.  **The Friction (Process Alibi)**
    *   *Lie*: "It's too big."
    *   *Counter*: **The Spark** (Micro-action <15m).

3.  **The Fantasy (Have-it-all Alibi)**
    *   *Lie*: "I can change without sacrifice."
    *   *Counter*: **The Trade-Off** (Conflict Resolution).

**Agent Tone**: "The Compassionate Engineer." (Empathy for the human, zero tolerance for the bullshit).

> **See Full Logic**: [`decomposition-logic.md`](decomposition-logic.md) for the detailed Decision Trees and Prying Protocol.

The chat interface acts as a **Decomposition Agent**.


**Step 1: Clarify the Objective**
*   Agent: "You said you want to 'start a business'. What does that look like in 1 year?"
*   *Why*: Removes vagueness (the enemy of momentum).

**Step 2: Identify the Bottleneck**
*   Agent: "What is stopping you from doing that *today*?"
*   *Why*: Identifies the immediate constraint (e.g., "I don't have an idea" vs "I'm afraid to sell").

**Step 3: Define the Immediate Milestone**
*   Agent: "Okay, then the only goal for Month 1 is to [Solve Bottleneck]. Ignore everything else."
*   *Why*: Focus creates momentum.

**Step 4: Assign the Spark**
*   Agent: "To officialize this, your first task is [Task]. Can you do this right now?"
*   *Why*: Commitment consistency.

## 4. The Output Artifact

The user receives a clean, functional **Action Plan**.

**Structure**:
1.  **North Star**: [Objective]
2.  **Current Phase**: [Milestone 1]
3.  **Active Projects**: [Initiatives]
4.  **Today's Task**: [The Spark]

**Value Proposition**: "You walked in with a dream. You're walking out with a todo list."
