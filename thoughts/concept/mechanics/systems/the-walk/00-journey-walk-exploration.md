## The Core Insight

**Star Map = FREE (who you are NOW)**
**Journey = PREMIUM (who you're BECOMING)**

## The Conversion Flow

```
DAY 1-7:      Mirror (excavation, free)
DAY 7:        Birth Chart Reveal (constellation snapshot, free)
DAY 7-8:      Discovery Interview (goal setting, free)
DAY 8:        Course Plotted (stars placed, free)

## If "Not Yet"

- Star map remains visible
- Path remains plotted (grayed/frozen)
- Gentle whispers every few days
- Expires after 30 days without action
- Context preserved if they return

---

## The Physics Metaphor

```
USER POSITION:     State vector in 5D space [P, M, E, C, G]
DESTINATION STAR:  Target position to reach (milestone)
VELOCITY:          How fast user is moving through state space
MOMENTUM:          Accumulated energy from sustained action
THRUST:            Force applied when reaching milestones
GRAVITY:           Pull from approaching stars (urgency increases)
```

---

## Multi-Journey

- Max 3 active journeys
- Capacity pool shared (total 3 experiments/day)
- Journeys can be in different domains (Career, Health, etc.)
- Cross-journey momentum possible

---

## Stickiness Mechanics

1. **Context accumulation** — Every step is irreplaceable data
2. **Momentum visibility** — You can SEE your velocity
3. **Incomplete journeys** — Walking away = abandoning your own North Star
4. **Identity investment** — Each milestone updates who you believe you are
5. **The archive** — "Remember your first star? Look how far you've walked"

---

## LTV Drivers

1. Multiple sequential journeys (finish one, start another)
2. Journey refinement ("I thought I wanted X, now Y")
3. Milestone celebrations (worth paying to feel)
4. Sabbatical return (context preserved)
5. The archive (8 months of history)
