## The Core Idea

This isn't another AI coaching app.

It's a mirror made of starlight. You answer questions, and stars appear. Over seven days, your constellation forms. After that, it evolves based on what you do — not just what you say.

The moat isn't the data.
The moat is the experience of watching yourself become.

## The Stripped Version

The `stripped/` subfolder contains a rationalized, "KISS" version that optimizes for validation speed. It cuts the visual poetry in favor of text summaries and kill thresholds.

That version validates faster but has no soul.

This folder is the real vision.

## Start Here

Read `00-vision.md` first. Then whatever draws you.
