# S.T.A.R.S. Visual Design Bible

**The canonical reference for all visual design in S.T.A.R.S.**

> *"The visual poetry isn't decoration. It's the product."*

## Philosophy

The interface is not a tool. It is a temple—a sacred space where users witness themselves becoming. Every color, every motion, every pixel must communicate that the user is engaging in something meaningful.

**Read first:** [Modus Operandi](00-modus-operandi.md) — Our north stars, inspirations, and test questions.

## Quick Reference

### The Test Questions

Before any visual decision ships:

1. **The Astrolabe Test:** Does this feel like precision-etched brass, or a software widget?
2. **The Specimen Test:** Would this star look at home in a 17th-century curiosity cabinet?
3. **The Mycelium Test:** Does this connection feel like it *grew*, or was *placed*?
4. **The Lens Test:** Could you imagine this scene photographed through an optical instrument?
5. **The Temple Test:** Would this element feel appropriate at the entrance to a space of self-reflection?

### The Watchwords

| Watchword | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Temple, not Tool | The interface is sacred space |
| Grown, not Drawn | Organic emergence, not vector precision |
| Witnessed, not Analyzed | The user sees themselves, not their metrics |
| Artifact, not Interface | Precious objects, not disposable UI |
| Photographed, not Rendered | The lens effect—as if captured by a camera |
| Calm, not Urgent | Nothing demands, everything invites |
| Night, not Day | Darkness is foundational, not optional |
