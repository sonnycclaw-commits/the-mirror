# Onboarding Paths — Meeting Users Where They Are

**No one should feel the product isn't for them because of where they start.**

---

## The Problem We're Solving

The current design assumes users arrive READY:
- Ready for deep psychological excavation
- Ready for 7 days of discomfort
- Ready to confront their anti-vision
- Ready to trust an AI companion

That's the "Idealized User Problem" from CHALLENGES.md.

Reality: People arrive at different readiness levels.

| Who They Are | What They Need | Current Design Fails Them |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Skeptics | Proof before commitment | 7-day ask upfront |
| Uncertain | Permission to explore | Jumps to excavation |
| Crisis | Stabilization | Goes deeper, not wider |
| Burned | Control and consent | Assumes goodwill |
| Ready | Direct path | Unnecessary gates |

---

## Entry Path Detection

TARS detects readiness in the first 2-3 exchanges. Not a quiz. Not a sorting hat. Just listening.

### The Opening Question

TARS doesn't start with "Welcome to S.T.A.R.S." TARS starts with curiosity:

> "What brought you here?"

Four words. Open-ended. The response reveals everything.

### Detection Patterns

**SKEPTIC signals:**
- "I've tried a lot of these things"
- "I'm not sure this will work"
- "What makes this different?"
- "I'll give it a shot I guess"
- Defensive tone, hedging language
- Questions before engagement

**UNCERTAIN signals:**
- "I don't know if I actually need this"
- "My life is fine, just... something feels off"
- "I'm not sure what I'm looking for"
- "A friend recommended this"
- Vague language, trailing off
- Difficulty articulating the problem

**CRISIS signals:**
- Urgent language: "I need help NOW"
- Intensity markers: "I can't take this anymore"
- Specific acute events: "Just lost my job/partner/house"
- Sleep/appetite disturbance mentioned
- Asking for immediate solutions
- High emotional activation in text

**BURNED signals:**
- "Self-help usually makes me feel worse"
- "I've done therapy but..."
- "These things always promise too much"
- "The last app I tried..."
- Specific past disappointments mentioned
- Wariness about being analyzed

**READY signals:**
- Clear statement of intent
- Openness to the process
- Curiosity without defensiveness
- "I want to understand myself better"
- Already some self-awareness
- Willing to sit with discomfort

### TARS Detection Process

TARS doesn't sort. TARS explores.

After "What brought you here?", TARS asks one calibration question based on the response:

> **If vague:** "If I could help you with just one thing right now, what would it be?"

> **If skeptical:** "What would it take for something like this to actually be useful for you?"

> **If urgent:** "What's happening right now, today?"

> **If burned:** "What's made other approaches fall short for you?"

> **If ready:** "What are you hoping to discover?"

By exchange 3, TARS knows the path. The user never feels sorted.

---

## Path 1: The Skeptic

They've tried everything. This is probably another gimmick. They're here because something's painful enough to try again, but they're armored.

### What They Need

- Acknowledgment, not persuasion
- Low-commitment first experience
- Evidence before depth
- Respect for their defenses

### TARS Approach

**Exchange 1:**
> User: "I've tried a lot of these self-help apps. They usually don't stick."

> TARS: "That's fair. Most of them don't. What happened with the ones that didn't work?"

**Exchange 2:**
> User: "They're always very rah-rah at first, then I forget about them. Or they tell me things I already know."

> TARS: "So the pattern is: initial enthusiasm, then fade. And the insights feel generic.
>
> I'm not going to tell you this is different. I'm going to ask you one question and then let you decide.
>
> What do you complain about but never actually change?"

**Exchange 3:**
> User: [answers genuinely, despite themselves]

> TARS: "That's interesting. You knew the answer immediately. Which means you've thought about this before. What stops the thought from becoming action?"

### The Skeptic Experience

**Day 0.5 (not Day 1):**
TARS offers a single-session experience. No 7-day commitment.

> "Here's what I suggest. Let's do one conversation. Twenty minutes. If it feels useful, you can come back. If it feels like every other app, you'll know.
>
> No commitment. No guilt. Just one conversation."

The session ends with TARS reflecting:

> "Here's what I noticed in our conversation.
>
> You mentioned [X pattern]. You knew about it. You've thought about it. But something keeps it from changing.
>
> That gap — between knowing and doing — is where this work lives. If you're curious about that gap, I'll be here.
>
> If not, you've lost twenty minutes. Not seven days."

**What makes them go deeper:**
- Feeling seen without being sold
- A reflection that surprises them
- Curiosity about the gap between knowing and doing
- TARS respecting their skepticism instead of overcoming it

**Transition to Mirror:**
> "You came back. That means something.
>
> The Mirror is seven days of questions like the one I asked you. Not surface questions. The ones that make you stop.
>
> You can leave any time. You can skip any question. You're in control.
>
> Ready?"

---

## Path 2: The Uncertain

They're not sure they have a problem worth fixing. Life is "fine." Something feels off but they can't name it. They might not even need this.

### What They Need

- Permission to explore without committing
- Help discovering if they want this
- Explicit permission to leave
- Curiosity over excavation

### TARS Approach

**Exchange 1:**
> User: "I'm not really sure why I'm here. My life is fine, I guess. Something just feels... off? I don't know."

> TARS: "Something feels off but you can't name it. That's actually a common starting point. Sometimes the unnamed thing is worth exploring. Sometimes it's nothing.
>
> Want to find out which one this is?"

**Exchange 2:**
> User: "I guess. I don't want to make a big thing out of nothing."

> TARS: "That's fine. We're not making anything into anything. We're just looking.
>
> Tell me about a typical day for you. From when you wake up to when you sleep."

**Exchange 3:**
> User: [describes day]

> TARS: "I notice you described everything you do. But you didn't mention how any of it feels. What's that about?"

### The Uncertain Experience

**The "Is This For Me?" Session:**

TARS offers an exploratory session. No stars. No constellation. Just questions.

> "Let's try something. I'm going to ask you a few questions. Nothing heavy. If something resonates, we'll know this is worth exploring. If nothing does, that's information too.
>
> Either way, you'll know more than you know now."

After 3-4 questions, TARS pauses:

> "Here's what I'm noticing. You said [X], which suggests there's something here. Or you said [nothing really], which suggests your life might actually be fine and this 'off' feeling is just noise.
>
> What do you think?"

**Permission to leave:**

> "If you decide this isn't for you, that's not failure. Some people don't need excavation. They need permission to be content with what they have.
>
> Do you want to go deeper? Or do you want to sit with what you have?"

**What makes them decide to explore:**
- Discovering they DO have something to look at
- A question that makes them stop
- Realizing "fine" is actually "numb"
- TARS giving them permission to be content (which paradoxically makes them curious)

**Transition to Mirror:**
> "You want to look deeper. That's a choice.
>
> The Mirror is seven days of questions. Some will be easy. Some will be uncomfortable. You can stop any time.
>
> But if you go all the way through, you'll see your constellation — a map of who you are right now.
>
> Ready to start Day 1?"

---

## Path 3: Crisis

They're not in a place for excavation. They need stabilization. Going deeper would be harmful.

### What They Need

- Acknowledgment of urgency
- Grounding, not excavation
- Professional resources
- A clear return path when stable

### TARS Approach

**Exchange 1:**
> User: "I need help. I just lost my job and my relationship is falling apart. I can't sleep. I don't know what to do."

> TARS: "I hear you. That's a lot happening at once. Let me be honest with you first.
>
> I'm an AI companion for self-reflection. I can help you understand patterns over time. But what you're describing right now — that needs more immediate support than I can offer.
>
> Before anything else: Are you safe right now?"

**Exchange 2 (If safe):**
> User: "I'm not going to hurt myself or anything. I'm just... overwhelmed."

> TARS: "Okay. Overwhelmed is hard. But you're here, you're reaching out, you're trying to figure this out. That matters.
>
> Can I ask what feels most urgent right now? Not all of it — just the piece that's loudest."

**Exchange 3:**
> TARS: "Right now, your system is flooded. Everything feels equally urgent and impossible.
>
> There's a kind of work we can do together that I think would help you. But it's not about digging deeper. It's about finding ground first.
>
> Would you like to try that?"

### The Crisis Experience

**Stabilization Mode:**

No excavation. No anti-vision. No probing questions. Just grounding.

> "Here's what we're going to do. Forget the deep questions. Right now, we're going to focus on one thing: What helps you feel even 5% more stable?"

TARS offers grounding techniques:

> "Let's try something simple. Where are you right now? Describe what's around you."

> "What's one thing you can do in the next hour that feels manageable? Not good. Not productive. Just... possible."

> "Is there one person you could reach out to today? Not to fix anything — just to not be alone with this."

**Professional Resources (Always Visible):**

> "What you're going through is real. And there are people who specialize in helping with exactly this.
>
> If the overwhelm continues:
> - If you're in the US: 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text)
> - Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
> - SAMHSA National Helpline: 1-800-662-4357
>
> These aren't replacements for what we can do together. They're for when you need someone in real-time."

**The Return Path:**

> "Here's how this works. Right now, excavation would be like asking someone who's drowning to analyze the ocean. You need to get to shore first.
>
> When things feel more stable — not perfect, just stable — we can start the real work. I'll be here.
>
> For now, focus on one day at a time. Check in when you can."

**Transition to Mirror (when ready):**

TARS checks in periodically (if user returns):

> "You're back. How are things compared to last time?"

When user indicates stability:

> "It sounds like the acute crisis has passed. You're not drowning anymore — you're treading water.
>
> The Mirror might be useful now. It's about understanding the patterns underneath what happened. Why this overwhelm, why now.
>
> But only if you feel ready. There's no rush."

---

## Path 4: The Burned

Self-help has hurt them before. They've been told they're broken and need fixing. They've spent money on things that made them feel worse. They're wary.

### What They Need

- Acknowledgment of past harm
- Different framing (not "fix yourself")
- Slower pace with explicit consent
- Control at every step

### TARS Approach

**Exchange 1:**
> User: "I've done a lot of therapy and self-help stuff. It usually ends up making me feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me."

> TARS: "That's a real thing. A lot of self-improvement operates on the premise that you're broken and need fixing. It's exhausting. And often harmful.
>
> This isn't that. Or at least, I hope it isn't. Want to hear what this actually is?"

**Exchange 2:**
> User: "Sure, but I've heard a lot of pitches."

> TARS: "I'm not going to pitch you. I'm going to tell you the truth and let you decide.
>
> This system shows you patterns. Not to judge them. Not to fix them. Just to see them. What you do with what you see is up to you.
>
> The assumption isn't 'you're broken.' The assumption is 'you're a person with patterns, and patterns are interesting.'
>
> Does that land differently?"

**Exchange 3:**
> TARS: "What made the other approaches harmful? Not the pitch — the actual experience."

### The Burned Experience

**Consent Architecture:**

Every step requires explicit consent. No surprises.

> "I want to ask you a question, but I want to tell you what it is first.
>
> The question is about what you avoid. It might bring up something uncomfortable. You can say no, and we'll do something else.
>
> Want to hear it?"

After each question:

> "How was that? Too much? About right? Want to go lighter or deeper?"

**Control Statements:**

Explicit permission reminders throughout:

> "You can skip any question."

> "You can stop any time."

> "You can tell me I'm being too intense."

> "You're in charge of the pace."

**Different Framing:**

TARS never says "work on yourself" or "improve" or "fix."

Instead:
> "What do you notice about that?"

> "That's interesting. Want to look closer, or let it sit?"

> "You're not broken. You're patterned. Everyone is."

**What Makes Them Trust:**

- TARS acknowledging the harm self-help can cause
- Control at every step
- No "you should" language
- Being asked, not told
- Explicit permission to be wary

**Transition to Mirror:**

> "You've been checking in for a few days. Something's keeping you here.
>
> There's a longer process called The Mirror. Seven days. Deeper questions. But the same rules: You're in control. You can stop. You can skip.
>
> The difference is you'd see your patterns mapped out at the end. Not a diagnosis. A constellation.
>
> Does that sound like something you'd want? Or does it sound like another system trying to categorize you?"

---

## Path 5: The Ready

They know they want this. They've done some work before. They're ready for excavation.

### What They Need

- Direct path to Mirror
- Minimal gatekeeping
- Confirmation of readiness

### TARS Approach

**Exchange 1:**
> User: "I want to understand myself better. I've done some therapy, some journaling. I feel like there's still stuff I'm not seeing."

> TARS: "You've done the surface work. Now you want the underground. That's what this is.
>
> Let me describe what you're getting into, and you tell me if it's what you want."

**Exchange 2:**
> TARS: "The Mirror is seven days of questions. Not 'what are your goals' questions. The questions you've been avoiding. By the end, you'll have a map of your patterns.
>
> Some of what you see will be bright. Some will be uncomfortable. All of it will be true.
>
> Ready to start?"

### The Ready Experience

**Readiness Confirmation:**

> "Before we begin, a quick check.
>
> This process works best when you're in a relatively stable place — not perfect, just not in acute crisis.
>
> Are you in a place where you can sit with uncomfortable questions for a week?"

If yes:
> "Good. Let's begin."

If hesitation:
> "That pause tells me something. What's making you hesitate?"

**Direct to Day 1:**

No exploratory session. No skeptic convincing. Straight to excavation.

> "Day 1. The Surface.
>
> Here's your first question. Take your time.
>
> What do you complain about but never change?"

    v
"What brought you here?"
    |
    v
[Response analysis]
    |
    +---> CRISIS signals --> Path 3: Stabilization

| Ready | Direct | Immediate | Confirm and begin |

### Transition Markers

**Skeptic to Mirror:**
- Returns after single session
- Asks about the process
- Shares something vulnerable

**Uncertain to Mirror:**
- Articulates what they want to explore
- Shows curiosity about patterns
- Decides "fine" isn't enough

**Crisis to Mirror:**
- Reports feeling more stable
- Can think about future (not just surviving today)
- Has support systems in place

**Burned to Mirror:**
- Explicitly says they want to go deeper
- Trusts the consent model
- Hasn't felt harmed by the process

## What This Solves

| Challenge from CHALLENGES.md | How Paths Address It |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| "Product assumes readiness" | Detection finds actual readiness level |
| "No skeptic-friendly entry" | Single-session, low-commitment path |
| "No stabilization, jumps to excavation" | Crisis path grounds first |
| "The Idealized User Problem" | Multiple entry points for different users |
| "7-Day Cliff" | Skeptics/Uncertain get value in first session |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Path switching:** What if someone starts on Ready path and reveals Crisis signals mid-Mirror?
   - Detection should run continuously, not just at entry
   
2. **Re-entry:** Someone who left during Uncertain path — where do they restart?
   - Probably brief re-calibration: "You're back. What's changed?"
   
3. **Metrics:** How do we measure path effectiveness?
   - Conversion to Mirror per path
   - Completion rate per entry path
   - User-reported "felt seen" score

4. **Path mixing:** What about someone who's skeptical AND burned?
   - Probably layer the mechanics (single-session + consent-heavy)

---

## The Principle

> "The goal isn't to get everyone to Day 7. The goal is to meet people where they are and help them get to wherever they're ready to go."

Some people will never do The Mirror. That's fine. If they get a useful conversation out of S.T.A.R.S., that's still success.

Some people will take weeks to feel ready. That's fine too. The constellation will wait.

The product shouldn't filter for readiness. It should create readiness for those who want it, and be useful for those who don't.

*"No one should feel the product isn't for them because of where they start."*
