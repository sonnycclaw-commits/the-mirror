# The Mirror — Seven Days of Excavation

**Day 1-7 of the S.T.A.R.S. journey**

---

## The Premise

Most people have never been asked the right questions.

Not the "what are your goals" questions. Not the "rate your satisfaction" questions. The questions that make you stop. The questions that reveal what you've been hiding from yourself.

The Mirror is seven days of those questions.

---

## The Experience

### Day 1: The Surface

TARS appears. Not with a greeting — with a question.

> "What do you complain about but never change?"

The star map is empty. Black sky, faint nebula. Nothing yet.

You answer. A star appears — dim, uncertain. Your first light.

TARS doesn't analyze. TARS asks another question.

> "What would someone conclude about your priorities by watching how you actually spend your time?"

Another star. This one further from the first. A gap between what you say and what you do.

By the end of Day 1, you have 3-5 stars scattered across your sky. No pattern yet. Just light emerging from darkness.

**But Day 1 doesn't end with just scattered stars.** TARS offers a first reflection:

> "Here's what I notice from today.
>
> You complain about [X] but keep doing [Y]. There's a gap there — between what frustrates you and what you're choosing.
>
> Your first stars are scattered across [domains]. No pattern yet. But something is already visible: [one insight].
>
> Tomorrow, we go deeper. For now, sit with this: What do you notice about your own sky?"

**This is the Day 1 hook.** Not the full Birth Chart — but enough to say "this thing sees me." Enough to come back tomorrow.

## Addressing the 7-Day Cliff

Industry data is brutal:
- 92% of books unfinished
- 97% of courses abandoned
- 90% of apps abandoned within 3 days

We can't ask for 7 days of trust before showing value.

**The solution: Micro-revelations every day.**

| Day | Micro-Revelation |
|-----|------------------|
| Day 1 | First reflection: "Here's what I notice" |
| Day 2 | First connection drawn between stars |
| Day 3 | First dark star appears (anti-vision) |
| Day 4 | Pattern TARS noticed that user didn't |
| Day 5 | First prediction: "You seem to [X] when [Y]" |
| Day 6 | Shadow star named |
| Day 7 | Full Birth Chart reveal |

Each day delivers something. The 7-day journey builds anticipation for Day 7 without making users wait 7 days to feel seen.

**The cliffhanger:** Every day ends with a hint of what's coming:

> "Tomorrow, we look at the life you're afraid of becoming. Rest tonight."

---

### Day 2-3: The Descent

The questions go deeper.

> "Describe, vividly, the life you're terrified of living ten years from now."

This is the anti-vision. Not to frighten — to clarify. The dark star appears. Something you're moving away from. Now you can see it.

> "When was the last time you felt fully alive? What were you doing?"

A bright star. Gold-coral glow. Something true about you. Now you can see that too.

The constellation isn't forming yet. But you're starting to see the raw materials.

### Day 4-5: The Connections

TARS begins to notice patterns.

> "You mentioned your partner twice when talking about what drains you, and zero times when talking about what energizes you. I'm not saying anything is wrong. I'm curious what you notice about that."

A line draws between two stars. A connection you hadn't seen.

> "You said 'when I have time' three times yesterday. What are you waiting for permission to do?"

Another connection. A pattern emerging.

You're no longer just seeing stars. You're seeing how they relate.

### Day 6: The Integration

The shadow work.

> "What part of yourself have you been trying to hide? Not from others — from yourself."

A dim star appears. Not bright, not dark. Waiting. This is the aspect that wants to be integrated, not eliminated.

TARS doesn't push. TARS sits with you.

> "That star doesn't have to be bright right now. It just has to be seen."

### Day 7: The Birth Chart

The reveal.

Your constellation appears in full — every star you've uncovered, every connection drawn, every pattern visible for the first time.

TARS narrates what you're seeing:

> "Here's what I see in your sky.
>
> You have three bright stars clustered around Purpose — your work, your writing, your desire to create something meaningful. This is where you shine.
>
> But there's a dark star in Relationships, pulling energy. Your partner appears connected to 'obligation' more than 'joy.' That's not judgment — that's the pattern your own words drew.
>
> And there's a flickering star here, in Health. You mentioned wanting to feel strong again. It's emerging. Not stable yet, but emerging.
>
> This is your Birth Chart. This is who you are right now. Not who you have to be."

## The Questions (Core Protocol)

Each day has 3-5 questions. These are the anchors:

### Identity Questions
- What do you complain about but never change?
- What would someone conclude watching your behavior?
- What are you pretending not to know?
- Who were you before you learned to be afraid?

### Anti-Vision Questions
- What is the life you refuse to live?
- What's the worst-case path you're currently on?
- What are you tolerating that you shouldn't?

### Vision Questions
- When did you last feel fully alive?
- What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?
- What does "enough" mean to you?

### Shadow Questions
- What do you hide from yourself?
- What pattern keeps repeating despite your efforts?
- What are you afraid to want?

### Connection Questions
- Who energizes you vs. drains you?
- What relationships serve your becoming?
- Where are you seeking approval you don't need?

## The Birth Chart Moment

This is the emotional peak of the entire product.

Seven days of excavation. Seven days of stars appearing. Seven days of connections drawing. And then — the reveal.

The screen transitions. The camera pulls back. Your full constellation appears for the first time.

TARS speaks your chart. Not as analysis — as recognition.

The user doesn't feel assessed.
The user feels *seen*.

---

*"The Mirror doesn't tell you who you are. It shows you what you've already drawn."*
