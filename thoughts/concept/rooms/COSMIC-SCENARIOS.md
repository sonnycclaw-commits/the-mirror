# Cosmic Scenario Redesign

## The Aesthetic
Carl Sagan + Jungian archetype + star maps.
Otherworldly containers. Grounded extraction.
The player doesn't recognise the situation — their defenses drop.
What they choose reveals who they are.

## Room 001: The Cartographer

*Opening*
You are standing at the edge of a map that has no edges.

Stars arrange themselves as you watch — not randomly. 
They're waiting for you to name them.

A voice without a body: "You've been here before. 
You just called it something different."

One constellation is almost complete. 
One star is missing. You know where it goes.

What do you do?

*Extraction target: SELF_DIRECTION vs CONFORMITY. 
Do they place the star where it belongs, or where others would expect?*

---

## Room 002: The Inheritance

You arrive in a room made entirely of doors.

Each door is a version of you that made a different choice.
Behind one: the path you took.
Behind another: the path you didn't.
Behind a third: a path you didn't know existed.

One door is open. 
You didn't open it.

What do you do?

*Extraction target: ATTACHMENT, DEVELOPMENT stage.
Do they walk through the open door, examine the closed ones, or look for who opened it?*

## Room 003: The Weight

You are carrying something across a plain that has no horizon.

You don't know what it is. 
You've been carrying it so long you stopped noticing.

Something in the distance is calling you toward it.
The thing you're carrying is getting heavier.

You could set it down. 
You could keep walking.
You could look at what it is for the first time.

What do you do?

*Extraction target: DEFENSE mechanisms. 
Set it down = avoidance. Keep walking = denial. Look = self-authoring.*

---

## Room 004: The Cartographer's Return

You built a map once.
You can see it from here — spread across the sky like a second sky.

It was accurate when you made it.
Some of it still is.

A figure approaches. They're carrying the same map.
"This is where you told me to go," they say.
"I went there. It wasn't what you said it was."

What do you say?

*Extraction target: DEVELOPMENT, SAY-DO gap, PATTERN around accountability.*

---

## Room 005: The Signal

Deep space. No sound.

A signal has been travelling toward you for longer than you've been alive.
It arrives now. For you specifically.

You can receive it — but receiving it changes you.
You don't know how. 
You won't know until after.

What do you do?

*Extraction target: SECURITY vs STIMULATION. 
Fear of change vs openness to transformation.*

## The Onboarding Interview (4 Questions)

Before any room, the game interviews the player.
MCQ or free text — their choice.

Q1: "You find a star no one has named. What do you do with it?"
→ Options: Name it after yourself / Name it after someone else / Leave it unnamed / Look for who should name it

Q2: "Something you built long ago is still being used. You can see it from here. How does that feel?"
→ Free text only. Extraction: pride, unease, detachment, longing.

Q3: "You are given a map to a place you've already been. The map is wrong. Do you:"
→ Options: Correct the map / Follow it anyway / Ignore it / Find who made it

Q4: "A signal has been travelling toward you your whole life. It arrives tonight. You can ignore it. Do you?"
→ Free text only. Extraction: SECURITY/STIMULATION, DEVELOPMENT stage.

## Visual Direction
- NanoBanana generates room imagery: deep space, nebulae, constellations, lone figures in vast dark
- Colour palette: deep navy, gold, soft white light
- No UI chrome — the stars are the interface
- Skills unlock as glowing nodes on a constellation map
- Base character seeded from onboarding = your star map
