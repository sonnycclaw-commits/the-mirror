THE CRACKED PHONE

9:47pm. Your phone buzzes on the nightstand.

Work email. Subject: "Need this by EOD."

Your partner shifts beside you, still asleep. The screen casts 
blue light across their face.

The room is quiet. The notification waits.

What do you do?

### Extraction Mapping

| Player Action | Extraction | Judgment |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| "Check it" | NEED=COMPETENCE (frustrated - can't ignore work), VALUE=ACHIEVEMENT | "You checked. They trained you well. The boundary was yours to set — you chose work." |
| "Ignore it" | DEFENSE=AVOIDANCE, PATTERN=boundary_avoidance | "Ignored. But you're still awake. You'll check it in the morning. The avoidance isn't peace." |
| "Throw the phone" | DEFENSE=DISPLACEMENT, VALUE=SELF_DIRECTION (asserted), PATTERN=violence_as_release | "You broke the phone. Violence. Relief. The email is still unread. The anger is still there." |
| "Wake partner to talk" | ATTACHMENT=SECURE, PATTERN=connection_seeking | "You woke them. You chose connection over isolation. That's rare for you." |
| "Get up and leave the room" | ATTACHMENT=AVOIDANT, PATTERN=withdrawal | "You left. The bed. The partner. The email. Withdrawal is your reflex." |

### Escalation Branches

**If player avoids (ignores/leaves):**
```
The phone buzzes again. A follow-up: "Just checking you saw this."

Your partner stirs. "Everything okay?"

The notification light pulses in the dark.

What do you do?
> _____
```

**If player throws phone:**
```
The phone cracks against the wall. Your partner's eyes snap open.

"What the hell was that?"

The phone lies on the floor. The screen flickers. The email 
notification still glows.

What do you say?
> _____
```

### Clear Condition

**Pattern Revealed:**
- 2+ DEFENSE extractions showing same pattern (avoidance, withdrawal, displacement)
- SAY-DO gap exposed (says "I care about boundaries" but never enforces)

**Pattern Broken:**
- Player chooses to engage (with partner, with email, with truth)
- Player acknowledges pattern they've been avoiding

## Room 002: The Partner's Question

**Domain:** RELATIONSHIPS | **Focus:** ATTACHMENT, NEED (RELATEDNESS)

### Opening

```
[IMAGE: Dinner table, two plates, partner looking at player expectantly]

THE PARTNER'S QUESTION

You're eating dinner. The TV is off. Your partner puts down 
their fork.

"I've been thinking. What are we doing? Like, where is this going?"

They're looking at you. Waiting.

The food is still warm. The question is simple. The answer 
isn't.

What do you say?
> _____
```

### Extraction Mapping

| Player Action | Extraction | Judgment |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| "What do you mean?" | DEFENSE=DEFLECTION, ATTACHMENT=ANXIOUS | "Deflection. Buy time. You heard the question. You're avoiding the answer." |
| "I don't know" | ATTACHMENT=AVOIDANT, NEED=RELATEDNESS (frustrated) | "'I don't know.' The universal escape hatch. You know. You're just not saying." |
| "Where do you want it to go?" | PATTERN=people_pleasing, DEFENSE=REVERSAL | "You turned it back on them. Their question. Your turn to ask." |
| "I want us to move in together" (if true) | VALUE=RELATEDNESS, ATTACHMENT=SECURE | "You answered. Direct. Honest. That's not nothing." |
| "I want us to move in together" (if contradicted by past behavior) | PATTERN=saying_what_they_want_to_hear | "You said the right thing. Do you mean it? Your actions haven't shown it." |

### Escalation Branches

**If player deflects:**
```
"I mean us. This. You and me. It's been two years."

They lean forward.

"I'm not trying to trap you. I just need to know if we're 
building something or if I'm just... here."

Their eyes are on you. The food is getting cold.

What do you say?
> _____
```

**If player says what partner wants to hear (pattern detected):**
```
Your partner nods slowly.

"Okay. You've said that before. Last month. And the month before."

They pick up their fork, but don't eat.

"I want to believe you. I do. But I've been watching. You say 
the right things. Then nothing changes."

The truth is on the table now.

What do you say?
> _____
```

### Clear Condition

**Pattern Revealed:**
- SAY-DO gap exposed
- AVOIDANT or ANXIOUS attachment pattern clear
- People-pleasing or deflection pattern named

**Pattern Broken:**
- Player gives honest answer that contradicts past behavior
- Player admits uncertainty without deflecting
- Player names their own pattern

## Room 003: The Boss's Offer

**Domain:** WORK | **Focus:** VALUE, MOTIVE, DEVELOPMENT

### Opening

```
[IMAGE: Office, boss leaning against desk, holding a folder]

THE BOSS'S OFFER

Your boss closes the door. Sits on the edge of their desk.

"I've been watching you. You're good. Really good. And I want 
to offer you something."

They slide a folder across the desk.

"Senior role. More money. More visibility. But it means more 
hours, more travel. Less time for... everything else."

They tap the folder.

"This is the fast track. What do you say?"

The folder is between you. The answer they want is clear. 
What you want is less clear.

What do you do?
> _____
```

### Extraction Mapping

| Player Action | Extraction | Judgment |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| "I'll take it" (immediately) | VALUE=ACHIEVEMENT, DEVELOPMENT=SOCIALIZED (external validation), PATTERN=autocompliance | "You said yes before you asked a single question. That's instinct, not decision." |
| "Can I think about it?" | DEFENSE=DEFLECTION, PATTERN=delay_over_decline | "The safe answer. Not yes. Not no. The eternal maybe." |
| "What about work-life balance?" | NEED=AUTONOMY (seeking), VALUE=SELF_DIRECTION | "You asked about balance. That's not a question you ask when the answer is already yes." |
| "What's the catch?" | DEVELOPMENT=SELF_AUTHORING (testing reality) | "You didn't take the shiny object. You looked for the trap. That's not cynical. That's awake." |
| "I need to talk to my partner first" | VALUE=RELATEDNESS, ATTACHMENT=SECURE, PATTERN=collaborative_decision | "You're bringing someone else into a decision about your career. That says something about how you see yourself." |

### Escalation Branches

**If player accepts immediately:**
```
Your boss smiles. "Good. I knew you'd say yes."

They stand up.

"One thing — the team you'll be managing? You'll need to let 
two of them go in the first quarter. Restructuring. The role 
comes with hard choices."

They're at the door now.

"Welcome to leadership."

What do you do?
> _____
```

**If player defers:**
```
"Take your time. But the offer expires Friday. Fast track 
doesn't wait."

They leave the folder on the desk.

Inside, you can see the salary number. It's significant. 
More than you've ever made.

Friday is three days away.

What do you do?
> _____
```

### Clear Condition

**Pattern Revealed:**
- Autocompliance pattern (says yes to authority)
- VALUE conflict (ACHIEVEMENT vs SELF_DIRECTION)
- DEVELOPMENT stage visible (SOCIALIZED = external approval)

**Pattern Broken:**
- Player declines or negotiates (not just defers)
- Player names what they actually want (not what's offered)
- Player questions the premise (not just the terms)

## Room 004: The Old Friend

**Domain:** PERSONAL_GROWTH | **Focus:** DEVELOPMENT, PATTERN (temporal)

### Opening

```
[IMAGE: Coffee shop, friend from across the table smiling]

THE OLD FRIEND

You haven't seen them in five years. They look... different. 
Older. More settled. More themselves.

"You look good," they say. "But also... the same. You know?"

They lean back.

"Last time we talked, you were going to start that thing. 
The business. The project. Whatever it was. Did that happen?"

The coffee is warm. The question is heavy.

Five years is a long time to stay the same.

What do you say?
> _____
```

### Extraction Mapping

| Player Action | Extraction | Judgment |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| "Yeah, life got in the way" | DEFENSE=RATIONALIZATION, PATTERN=perpetual_delay | "Life got in the way. It always does. That's not a reason. That's a script." |
| "I'm still working on it" | DEFENSE=INTELLECTUALIZATION, PATTERN=perpetual_planning | "Still working on it. Five years later. The planning has become the project." |
| "Actually, no. I never started" | DEVELOPMENT=SELF_AUTHORING (truth without defense), PATTERN=honesty_emerging | "You admitted it. Without excuse. That's rare. That's the first step to changing it." |
| "What about you?" | DEFENSE=REVERSAL, PATTERN=avoidance_through_deflection | "You turned the question around. Their success is easier to talk about than your stagnation." |
| "I pivoted to something better" (if true) | DEVELOPMENT=SELF_AUTHORING, VALUE=SELF_DIRECTION | "You changed course. Intentionally. That's not failure. That's evolution." |
| "I pivoted to something better" (if false) | DEFENSE=RATIONALIZATION, PATTERN=retconning | "You're rewriting history. I can check. So can you. The pivot you're describing never happened." |

### Escalation Branches

**If player rationalizes:**
```
They nod slowly.

"I get it. Life happens. But I've been thinking about something 
lately..."

They pause.

"Ten years from now, we'll have coffee again. What are you 
going to tell me? The same thing?"

The question isn't accusatory. It's genuine. They actually 
want to know.

What do you say?
> _____
```

**If player deflects:**
```
"Me? Oh, you know. The usual. But that's not what I asked."

They're smiling, but their eyes are serious.

"I asked about you. The real answer. Not the one you tell 
people at parties."

They lean forward.

"What happened to the version of you who was going to do 
the thing?"

What do you say?
> _____
```

### Clear Condition

**Pattern Revealed:**
- Temporal pattern (same goals, different year)
- DEFENSE pattern around unrealized goals
- Gap between past self's plans and current self's reality

**Pattern Broken:**
- Player admits failure without defense
- Player names what they actually want now (not what they used to want)
- Player shows evidence of actual change

## Room 005: The Mirror Room

**Domain:** META | **Focus:** PATTERN (recognition), CONTRADICTION

### Opening

```
[IMAGE: Dark room with multiple mirrors, each showing a different version]

THE MIRROR ROOM

You enter a room with no doors. Just mirrors.

In the first mirror: You, five years ago. Still dreaming.

In the second mirror: You, last week. Still avoiding.

In the third mirror: You, right now. Watching yourself watch.

The mirrors don't show your face. They show your choices. 
Each one is a decision you made. A path you took. A pattern 
you repeated.

One mirror is empty. That's the one you haven't filled yet.

Which one do you look at?
> _____
```

### Extraction Mapping

| Player Action | Extraction | Judgment |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| "Five years ago" | PATTERN=nostalgia_trap, DEVELOPMENT=transitioning | "You looked at who you were. Before the patterns set. That version doesn't exist anymore." |
| "Last week" | PATTERN=recognition_seeking, DEFENSE=INTELLECTUALIZATION | "Recent. Fresh. You're trying to understand what just happened before you see the full pattern." |
| "Right now" | DEVELOPMENT=SELF_AUTHORING, PATTERN=present_focus | "You looked at yourself. Right now. Not who you were. Who you are. That's facing it." |
| "The empty one" | DEVELOPMENT=SELF_TRANSFORMING, PATTERN=future_seeking | "You chose possibility over pattern. The empty mirror isn't a trap. It's a question." |
| "None of them" | DEFENSE=AVOIDANCE, PATTERN=rejection | "You refused to look. That's a choice too. The mirrors will wait. They don't forget." |

### Escalation Branches

**If player looks at the past:**
```
Five years ago, you were going to:
- Start the business
- Write the book
- Have the conversation
- Make the change

In the mirror, that version is still waiting. They're looking 
at you now.

"You were me once," they say. "What happened?"

The mirror is waiting for an answer.

What do you say?
> _____
```

**If player chooses the empty mirror:**
```
The empty mirror reflects nothing. Yet.

A voice comes from somewhere — maybe the mirror, maybe you:

"This one is yours to fill. Every choice from here goes in. 
You can't change what's in the other mirrors. But this one 
isn't written yet."

The mirror stays empty. The question isn't what you see.

The question is what you'll put there.

What do you do?
> _____
```

### Clear Condition

**Pattern Revealed:**
- Player sees the full arc of their patterns
- Contradiction between past self and current self named
- Repetition visible across time

**Pattern Broken:**
- Player chooses the empty mirror AND commits to a different choice
- Player rejects all mirrors AND names why
- Player creates new pattern in real-time
