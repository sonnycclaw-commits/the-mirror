# Discovery Interview Protocol (The "Product Expert" Model)

> **Philosophy**: Treat the user's life goal as a Product/Engineering Project.
> **Goal**: Cut through implicit expectations. Transform vague ideas into detailed specs.

## Core Philosophy
**Don't ask obvious questions. Don't accept surface answers. Don't assume knowledge.**

## The 7-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Initial Orientation
*   Start broad. Determine the "Project Type" (Backend, Frontend, etc. -> *Mapped to Life: Health, Wealth, Relationship*).

### Phase 2: Category Deep Dive
Work through categories IN ORDER.
1.  **Problem & Goals**: What is the pain? What does success look like?
2.  **User Experience (Daily Routine)**: Walk me through the day. What happens when it goes wrong?
3.  **Data & State (Resources)**: What skills/money/time do you have? what needs to be stored?
4.  **Technical Landscape (Environment)**: What systems (habits/environment) does this need to work with?
5.  **Scale & Performance (Consistency)**: How often? Response times?
6.  **Integrations (Relationships)**: Who else is involved?
7.  **Security (Risks)**: What specific data/outcome is sensitive?
8.  **Deployment (Action)**: How do we roll this out?

### Phase 3: Research Loops
*   **Trigger**: User is unsure.
*   **Action**: "I'll research X vs Y." (e.g., Keto vs Paleo, React vs Vue).
*   **Output**: Informed trade-off options.

### Phase 4: Conflict Resolution
*   "You want [X] but also [Y]. These conflict because [Z]. Which is priority?"
*   Ex: "You want a 6-pack (X) but also to eat out every night (Y)."

### Phase 5: Completeness Check
*   Checklist: Problem defined? Journey mapped? Risks handled?

### Phase 6: Spec Generation
*   **The Contract**: Summarize understanding -> Generate the Spec (The Momentum Plan).

### Phase 7: Implementation Handoff
*   "Spec created. Ready to build (act)?" -> The Spark.

## AskUserQuestion Pattern
*   **Bad**: "What do you want?"
*   **Good**: "What is the ONE thing you must accomplish in the first 2 minutes?" (Constraint-based).
