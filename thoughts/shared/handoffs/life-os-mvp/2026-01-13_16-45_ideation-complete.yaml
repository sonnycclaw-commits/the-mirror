  session_type: ideation-refinement
  duration: ~2 hours

summary: |
  Comprehensive ideation session that took the app from discovery/research
  through to complete architectural clarity. Ran 20 questions exercise to
  crystallize strategic direction, defined the skill tree system, and
  consolidated all prior research into actionable specifications.

  The product is now ready for MVP development.

key_decisions:
  strategic_direction:
    - Core value: "Living profile + pathway navigation system"
    - Target user: Lost seekers + self-optimizers
    - Business model: Freemium (profile free, journey paid)
    - Exit strategy: Acquisition (Dan Koe partnership or major player)
    - Timeline: MVP in 6-8 weeks

  product_philosophy:
    - AI role: Mirror + Companion (reflects back, walks alongside)
    - Breakthrough moment: "Holy shit, that's ME" (feeling understood)
    - Pathway visualization: CORE differentiator (must have MVP)

  skill_tree:
    - Emergent skills (detected from conversation, not predefined)
    - 6 domains: Self-Awareness, Emotional, Cognitive, Behavioral, Relational, Directional
    - 36 total skills (15-20 for MVP)
    - 5 levels per skill (Unaware → Mastered)
    - Skyrim/PoE inspiration but less intimidating
    - Skills unlock through journey milestones

      - Primary SDT driver identified
      - 2-3 patterns detected
      - One key tension surfaced
      - Profile visualization

      - Shareable card
    paid_tier:
      - Full developmental stage
      - Detailed blocker analysis
      - Defense mechanisms
      - Complete skill tree
      - Skill development
      - Personalized journey

  red_lines:
    - NOT therapy replacement
    - NOT generic wellness app
    - Must handle legal/liability properly

    - Backend: Convex
    - AI: Claude API (structured outputs)
    - Auth: Clerk
    - Payments: Stripe
    - Notifications: Expo Push + JITAI logic

  pathway_visualization:
    mvp: Simplified list/vertical view
    v1.1: react-native-svg or WebView + ReactFlow
    v2.0: Full ReactFlow for web/tablet

mvp_scope:
  must_have:
    - Living profile (Bayesian, evolves through conversation)
    - Pathway visualization (node map - CORE differentiator)
    - "Unfuck Your Life" journey (Dan Koe framework)
    - Skill tree (15-20 skills, list view)
    - Shareable progress cards
    - Free profile, paid journey
    - Crisis detection

  not_building:
    - Multiple journeys (only Unfuck Your Life for MVP)
    - Full graph visualization (list only)
    - CBT/DBT protocols
    - Community features
    - Voice input
    - B2B features

success_metrics:
  north_star: "This is me" moment achievement rate (>80% of Day 7 users)
  conversion: Trial → paid >25%
  engagement: Daily return rate >50% first week
  pride_metric: "People say it changed their life"

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - Create MVP implementation plan (sprint breakdown)
    - Scaffold Expo + Convex project
    - Build Day 1 conversation flow
    - Implement basic profile schema

  soon:
    - Design pathway visualization component
    - Build extraction agent (signal detection)
    - Create prompt library (structured format)
    - Implement skill detection basics

  before_beta:
    - Crisis detection system
    - Stripe integration
    - Push notification system
    - Legal review of positioning

open_questions:
  - App name (not "Life OS" or "Unfuck Your Life" - needs new name)
  - Pricing ($15? $20? $25/month)
  - iOS-first or both platforms?
  - How to recruit 50-100 beta users?
  - Skyrim-style skill tree visualization complexity for MVP

skill_tree_inspiration:
  games_referenced:
    - Skyrim (constellation skill trees)
    - Path of Exile (sprawling interconnected web)
    - Diablo (class-based trees)
  adaptation_notes: |
    User wants the "epic unlocking power" feel but toned down for wellness.
    Less intimidating, more organic growth. Constellation aesthetic could
    work well - skills as stars, connections as lines, domains as
    constellations. The "night sky of your growth."

resume_context: |
  This session completed the ideation phase. All major architectural
  decisions have been made, the skill tree system is designed, and the
  freemium split is clear. The product vision is crystallized:

  "A living profile + pathway navigation system that helps lost seekers
  understand themselves (free) and transform their lives (paid)."

  The pathway visualization is the CORE differentiator and must be in MVP.
  Skills emerge from conversation and unlock through journey milestones.

  Next session should focus on MVP implementation - scaffolding the project
  and building the first flows.
