goal: Created Context Graph Technical Specification - the unified moat architecture synthesizing 173k words of scattered ideation
now: Decide which ideation documents to take forward vs archive - too many files, need consolidation

test: "ls thoughts/ideation/architecture/context-graph-spec.md && ls thoughts/ideation/CHALLENGES.md && ls thoughts/ideation/KISS-PLAN.md"

done_this_session:
  - task: Ran scout agent to explore ideation directory (173k words, 49 files)
    files: [opc/.claude/cache/agents/scout/ideation-landscape-20260114-220207.md]

  - task: Updated README.md and SYNTHESIS.md with comprehensive landscape view
    files: [thoughts/ideation/README.md, thoughts/ideation/SYNTHESIS.md]

  - task: Ran 3 parallel agents for adversarial review (premortem, JTBD, critic)
    files: [thoughts/ideation/CHALLENGES.md]

  - task: Created KISS validation plan with Day 0 MVP scope
    files: [thoughts/ideation/KISS-PLAN.md, thoughts/shared/plans/day0-mvp-plan.md]

  - task: Developed Context Graph conceptual model (the actual moat)
    files: [thoughts/ideation/visual/context-graph-model.md]

  - task: Ran 3 parallel agents to build unified spec (extraction, research, schema design)
    files: [thoughts/ideation/architecture/context-graph-spec.md, thoughts/shared/plans/context-graph-schema-plan.md]

blockers: []

questions:
  - Which ideation docs are authoritative vs superseded?
  - Should AI-patterns/ folder be deleted (wrong project - Renoz CRM)?
  - Is 7-day excavation still the plan or pivot to Day 1 MVP?

decisions:
  - context_graph_is_moat: "ChatGPT has memory (flat). Context Graph has understanding (structured behavioral accumulation). This is the actual differentiation."
  - synthesis_not_invention: "The Context Graph unifies existing components (Neo4j schema, state vectors, decay math, Bayesian updates) - they were scattered across docs, now unified."
  - three_implementation_options: "Option A (Airtable, 1 day) → Option B (PostgreSQL, 2 weeks) → Option C (Neo4j, 12 weeks). Start with A for validation."
  - half_life_decay: "Different edge types decay at different rates: identity (180 days), patterns (30 days), momentary (1 day)."
  - hybrid_prediction: "Rule-based + Bayesian + Granger causality for detecting 'X leads to Y' patterns."

findings:
  - original_moat_is_smoke: "Living profile is not differentiated - ChatGPT already has conversational memory. Structured behavioral accumulation is the real moat."
  - five_fatal_risks: "7-Day Cliff (HIGH), No Unit Economics (HIGH), Walk Doesn't Exist (HIGH), ChatGPT Encroachment (MEDIUM), Anti-Vision Retraumatizes (HIGH)"
  - zero_user_validation: "173k words of ideation, zero user interviews cited, no willingness-to-pay testing, no demand signals"
  - context_graph_was_already_designed: "Neo4j schema, temporal KG, decay math, state vectors - all existed in separate docs. This session unified them."

worked:
  - Parallel agent execution for adversarial review (3 agents simultaneously)
  - Scout agent for initial landscape exploration
  - Architect agent for schema design with 3 progressive options
  - Oracle agent for external research (Graphiti, Granger causality, stickiness formulas)

failed: []

next:
  - CRITICAL - Decide which ideation documents to keep vs archive
  - Consolidate to 5-7 authoritative documents maximum
  - Run user validation (Day 0 MVP or 2-week validation sprint)
  - Build Airtable prototype (Option A) to test Context Graph capture

files:
  created:
    - thoughts/ideation/CHALLENGES.md
    - thoughts/ideation/KISS-PLAN.md

    - thoughts/ideation/architecture/context-graph-spec.md
    - thoughts/shared/plans/day0-mvp-plan.md

  modified:

context_graph_importance: |
  The Context Graph Technical Specification (architecture/context-graph-spec.md) is the MOST IMPORTANT output of this session.

  It answers: "What makes this sticky when ChatGPT exists?"

  Answer: Not the conversation (ChatGPT can do that). The structured accumulation of:
  - STATED vs BEHAVIORAL delta (said vs did)
  - TEMPORAL patterns (when they succeed/fail)
  - RELATIONAL mapping (who helps/hinders)
  - PREDICTIONS that ChatGPT cannot make

  The spec unifies 5 previously scattered components:
  1. Neo4j property graph (from technical_architecture.md)
  2. Temporal Knowledge Graph (from technical_architecture.md)
  3. Behavioral signal layer (from life-os-unified-architecture.md)
  4. Psychometric belief state (from technical_architecture.md)
  5. State vector tracking (from discovery-session-2026-01-14.md)

  Implementation path: Airtable (validate) → PostgreSQL (V1) → Neo4j (scale)

document_consolidation_needed: |
  Current state: 49 files, 173k words - too many to maintain.

  AUTHORITATIVE (keep):
  - README.md (entry point)
  - SYNTHESIS.md (decision tracker)
  - CHALLENGES.md (critical review)
  - KISS-PLAN.md (validation path)
  - architecture/context-graph-spec.md (THE SPEC)
  - visual/context-graph-model.md (conceptual model)
  - vision/life-os-pitch.md (product vision)

  REFERENCE (archive or merge):
  - _deep_research/ (8 files, 797KB) - valuable research, but decisions extracted to SYNTHESIS
  - architecture/ (12 files) - consolidate into context-graph-spec.md
  - research/ (7 files) - findings extracted
  - content/ (2 files) - question bank, keep for implementation

  DELETE:
  - AI-patterns/ (11 files) - WRONG PROJECT (Renoz CRM architecture)

  Next session should make these consolidation decisions.
