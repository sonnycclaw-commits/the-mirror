goal: "Life OS discovery & research phase - market analysis, tech stack selection, skill tree architecture"
now: "Begin MVP implementation - scaffold Expo app with Convex backend"
test: "Review thoughts/ideation/architecture/research-synthesis.md for complete findings"

context: |
  Life OS is a gamified life transformation app based on Dan Koe's "Unfuck Your Life" framework.
  Core mechanic: Daily micro-sessions → AI builds psychometric profile → Skill tree emerges → Personalized pathways
  Positioning: "Spotify Wrapped for your psychology" + "Duolingo for self-discovery"
  Target: Digital natives who've tried and abandoned self-development apps
  North star metric: Assessment accuracy ("This is me" moment in first 7 days)

done_this_session:
  - task: Created CLAUDE.md with Dan Koe framework gamification model
    files: [CLAUDE.md]
  - task: Ran 20-question discovery interview defining product scope
    files: [thoughts/ideation/experiments/discovery-interview-findings.md]
  - task: Parallel research on opportunity space, Convex, structured outputs, skill emergence
    files: [thoughts/ideation/research/opportunity-space.md, thoughts/ideation/research/convex-research.md, thoughts/ideation/research/structured-outputs.md, thoughts/ideation/research/skill-emergence.md]
  - task: Synthesized tech architecture with agent contracts
    files: [thoughts/ideation/architecture/technical-architecture.md]
  - task: Defined 8-week MVP plan with 7-day free experience
    files: [thoughts/ideation/architecture/mvp-plan.md]
  - task: Reviewed user's independent deep research (5 comprehensive docs)
    files: [thoughts/ideation/_deep_research/]
  - task: Created research synthesis comparing agent vs deep research
    files: [thoughts/ideation/architecture/research-synthesis.md]

blockers: []

questions:
  - Journey length for paid tier (30-day sprints vs 90-day vs ongoing)?
  - Which HEXACO assessment library to use for conversational extraction?
  - How to handle users at different ego development stages in same app?

decisions:
  - convex_over_supabase: "Real-time native, AI Agent component built-in, vector search included"
  - hexaco_over_big5: "Honesty-Humility dimension aligns with character development focus"
  - mobile_first: "Pattern interrupts need push notifications - phones always in pocket"
  - minimal_gamification: "Focus on insight/accuracy, not XP/badges - avoid gamification pitfalls"
  - bayesian_profiling: "Confidence-weighted belief updates from conversation signals"
  - emergent_skills: "AI discovers skills from conversation, not predefined taxonomy"
  - jitai_notifications: "Just-in-time adaptive interventions for right message at right time"

findings:
  - market_gap: "No app combines deep personality understanding + continuous tracking + game mechanics + AI personalization (~$70B TAM)"
  - retention_crisis: "90% quit habit apps in 30 days - need strong 'This is me' moment"
  - moat_is_time: "Skill tree becomes irreplaceable after 6 months - switching cost approaches infinity"
  - ego_stages_critical: "9 Loevinger/Cook-Greuter stages require different prompts per stage"
  - unfuck_pathway: "3-phase journey: Excavation (Week 1) → Calibration (Month 1) → Evolution (Month 3+)"

worked:
  - "Parallel oracle agents for research (4 simultaneous) - fast comprehensive coverage"
  - "User discovery interview before research - focused the questions"
  - "Comparing agent research vs independent deep research - found critical JITAI gap"

failed:
  - "WebFetch on X.com - needed WebSearch instead for tweet content"

tech_stack:
  mobile: "React Native + Expo"
  backend: "Convex"
  ai: "Claude API with structured outputs"
  auth: "Clerk"
  payments: "Stripe"
  notifications: "JITAI system with EMA data"

mvp_phases:
  sprint_1: "Foundation + Day 1 experience (weeks 1-2)"
  sprint_2: "Days 2-6 + profile building (weeks 3-4)"
  sprint_3: "Day 7 + visualization + paywall (weeks 5-6)"
  sprint_4: "Polish + beta launch (weeks 7-8)"

seven_day_free:
  day_1: "First Impression - initial personality card hook"
  day_2: "Anti-Vision - surface fears"
  day_3: "Vision - surface desires"
  day_4: "Patterns - self-sabotage detection"
  day_5: "Strengths - natural abilities"
  day_6: "Blockers - what's holding back"
  day_7: "Full Reveal - 'This is me' + shareable card + paywall"

next:
  - "Scaffold Expo project with Convex integration"
  - "Implement Convex schema from technical-architecture.md"
  - "Design Day 1 onboarding flow with anti-vision prompts"
  - "Build JITAI notification system for pattern interrupts"
  - "Create shareable 'Spotify Wrapped' style card for Day 7"
