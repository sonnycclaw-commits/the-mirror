# S.T.A.R.S. User Definition

**Purpose:** Explicit definition of who we're building for. Every design decision should pass the "Would this resonate with [our user]?" test.

---

## The Core User: "The Stalled Succeeder"

> Someone who has achieved external success but feels internally stuck. They know something is wrong, but can't name it. They're ready for real work—not more tips and hacks.

### Demographics

| Attribute | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| **Age** | 28-45 |
| **Life stage** | Post-first-career-success, pre-midlife |
| **Income** | Middle to upper-middle (can afford $19/mo without pain) |
| **Education** | Generally college-educated |
| **Tech comfort** | High (daily smartphone user, comfortable with apps) |

### Psychographics

| Attribute | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| **Ego stage** | Stage 4-5 (Self-Aware → Conscientious) |
| **Frustration** | "I've tried self-help books, they don't stick" |
| **Shame trigger** | "I should have figured this out by now" |
| **Secret fear** | "Maybe this is as good as it gets" |
| **Hope** | "There's a version of me that knows what to do" |

## Job To Be Done

### When/Why They Seek Help

| Trigger | Context |
|---------|---------|
| **Achievement hangover** | "I hit the goal, but I feel... nothing" |
| **Pattern recognition** | "I keep making the same mistake with people/work/money" |
| **Life transition** | New job, breakup, turning 30/40, health scare |
| **Late-night dread** | "I'm on a path I didn't choose" |

### The Hiring Moment

> "I want to understand what's actually going on with me, not just get another set of tips."

They're not hiring:
- Motivation (they have enough energy to seek change)
- Content (they've read the books)
- Productivity (they're already "productive")

They're hiring:
- **A mirror** that shows them what they can't see themselves
- **A companion** who doesn't judge but also doesn't let them hide
- **A pathway** from insight to action

## Alternatives (What They Hire Instead Today)

| Alternative | Why It Fails | Our Advantage |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **ChatGPT / Claude** | No persistence, no structure, easy to avoid hard questions | Structured 7-day excavation + living profile |
| **Therapy** | $150-300/session, appointment friction, feels "too serious" | Always available, $19/mo, feels like exploration not treatment |
| **Journaling apps** | No feedback, goes in circles, doesn't surface patterns | TARS notices what you can't, connects the dots |
| **Productivity tools** | Helps you do more of what you're already doing | Helps you question what you're doing in the first place |
| **Headspace / Calm** | Treats symptoms (stress), not root cause (identity) | Goes to the root: who are you vs who do you want to be |

## Why S.T.A.R.S. Wins (For This User)

1. **The Mirror Is Visual** — Not just text insights; they *see* their constellation forming
2. **It Remembers** — Every conversation builds on the last; nothing lost
3. **It Notices** — TARS surfaces patterns they couldn't see themselves
4. **It's Structured** — 7-day protocol gives shape to formless "I want to improve"
5. **It Moves** — The Walk transforms insight into action

---

## Who This Is NOT For

| Anti-Persona | Why Not |
|--------------|---------|
| **Acute crisis** | They need stabilization, not excavation |
| **Self-help skeptics** | They won't tolerate 7 days of introspection |
| **Quick-fix seekers** | They want hacks, we offer depth |
| **Perfectly content** | No tension to resolve |
| **Under 25** | Still forming identity, excavation premature |

---

## Risks With This User

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **7-day cliff** | Daily micro-revelations prevent "where's my value?" frustration |
| **Retraumatization** | Crisis detection + escalation protocol |
| **ChatGPT comparison** | The experience IS the moat, not the data |
| **"I already know myself"** | TARS reveals what they don't know they don't know |

## Validation Needed

This definition is synthesized from existing docs, not validated with users.

Before Beta:
- [ ] Interview 10 people who match profile
- [ ] Run 5 concierge users through 7-day protocol
- [ ] Test constellation metaphor resonance (A/B alternatives)
- [ ] Validate $19/mo willingness-to-pay
