## Recommended Exploration Order

1. **Section 1** (Overall feel) - Generate 5-10, pick direction
2. **Section 7** (Style tests) - Validate color temperature
3. **Section 2** (Star map) - Nail the core visualization
4. **Section 3** (Star states) - Establish visual vocabulary
5. **Section 5** (Backgrounds) - Create ambient textures
6. **Section 6** (Key moments) - Test emotional beats
7. **Section 4** (Connections) - Refine detail elements

Save your favorites to create the mood board for the artist brief or Layer/Scenario training.
