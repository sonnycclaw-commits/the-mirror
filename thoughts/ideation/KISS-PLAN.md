# S.T.A.R.S. KISS Plan

**Generated:** 2026-01-14
**Purpose:** The simplest path to learning if this should exist
**Principle:** Maximum learning, minimum building

---

## The Brutal Truth

Three independent agents converged on the same conclusion:

### 1. The Differentiation is Smoke
ChatGPT already does 90% of what's claimed:
- ✓ Conversational memory
- ✓ Deep questions
- ✓ Personalized advice
- ✓ Profile building over time

**Current differentiation score: 0.5/9**

The only "maybe" is the constellation UI, which is easily copied.

### 2. The Moat Doesn't Exist
"Switching cost approaches infinity" is false because:
- Users can re-answer questions elsewhere
- No network effects (1:1 with AI)
- Therapists prove this wrong — people switch after years

### 3. The Walk Doesn't Exist
173k words about insight. Zero words about action.

Insight ≠ Change. Without the Walk, this is an expensive self-awareness engine that doesn't cause transformation.

---

## What COULD Be Differentiated (If Built)

| Moat | What It Requires | Defensibility |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| **Validated psychometric accuracy** | Research partnership, validation studies | HIGH |
| **Behavior change infrastructure** | The Walk: implementation intentions, accountability, habit stacking | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **Crisis detection + safety** | Therapy partnerships, escalation protocols | HIGH |
| **Relationship mapping** | Two-person profiles, network effects | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **Narrow decision support** | "Should I take this job?" not general coaching | MEDIUM |

**None of these exist in the current design.**

---

## The KISS Test: Before Building Anything

### Option A: 2-Week Validation Sprint (No Code)

| Risk | Method | Pass Signal | Time | Cost |
|------|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **7-Day Cliff** | Concierge (10 users) | 60%+ complete Day 7 | 15-20 hrs | $0-100 |
| **Constellation resonance** | Survey (50 people) | 40%+ prefer it | 6-8 hrs | $0-50 |
| **$19/mo willingness** | Fake door landing page | 3%+ conversion | 8-10 hrs | $100-200 |
| **vs ChatGPT** | A/B comparison (5v5) | Measurably better | 10-15 hrs | $0-20 |
| **The Walk value** | Post-Day-7 prototype | 50%+ retain Day 14 | 8-10 hrs | $0-20 |

**Total:** ~50 hours + $100-400

**Decision rule:** Proceed if 3+ pass. Hard stop if Risk 1 or 4 fails.

### Option B: 30-Day Day 0 MVP (Minimal Code)

| Week | What | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | 10-min chat interview | Text profile |
| 2 | One personalized action | Calendar reminder |
| 3 | 7-day follow-up form | Did action → outcome data |
| 4 | Run 30 users through | Go/no-go decision |

**Stack:** v0.dev + Claude API + Resend + Typeform + Airtable

**Total cost:** ~$20/mo + domains

## The Cut List

Everything cut from the 173k-word ideation:

| Feature | Verdict | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 7-day excavation | **CUT → Day 1** | Prove insight works before commitment |
| Polar coordinate star map | **CUT** | Text summary validates the hypothesis |
| Mobile app | **CUT** | Web works, ships in 3 days not 3 weeks |
| HEXACO + SDT + Loevinger | **CUT** | "Feels accurate" is enough |
| TARS companion | **CUT** | Claude directly is enough |
| Skill tree visualization | **CUT** | Text list is enough |
| Stripe subscription | **CUT** | Validate value before monetization |
| Convex backend | **CUT** | Airtable works |
| Push notifications | **CUT** | Email reminder is enough |
| Phase transitions | **CUT** | Only matters if Day 1 works |
| Decay math (Bayesian) | **CUT** | Premature optimization |
| Social sharing | **CUT** | Add after validation |
| Champion Marketplace | **DEFER** | V2 platform play |

---

## Kill Thresholds

If any of these fail, STOP:

| Metric | Kill If Below |
|--------|---------------|
| Profile accuracy rating (1-5) | 3.5 average |
| % who take recommended action | 15% |
| % who report positive outcome | 20% |
| % who want next experiment | 25% |

**Sample size:** 25-30 completers (aim for 50 starts)

---

## Decision Framework

### If 3+ validations PASS:
1. Build lightweight web app (not mobile)
2. Focus on The Walk (behavior change, not insight)
3. Define one defensible moat and build toward it
4. Skip the 7-day excavation — test 3-day or Day-1

### If validations FAIL:
**Pivot options:**
- A) Compress to 3-day intensive (if 7 days too long)
- B) Drop subscription, sell one-time "Birth Chart" (if Walk fails)
- C) Become a prompt library for ChatGPT (if ChatGPT is enough)
- D) Pivot to narrow JTBD: relationship mapping, career decisions, crisis detection
- E) Kill the concept

---

## The Honest Questions

Before any building, answer these:

1. **What can you show in 30 days that ChatGPT + journaling cannot?**
   - If "nothing yet" → the moat doesn't exist

2. **Why would someone pay $19/mo instead of ChatGPT Pro ($20/mo)?**
   - ChatGPT has memory, voice, vision, unlimited usage
   - What does this have?

3. **What stops OpenAI from adding "Life Coach Mode"?**
   - If "nothing" → need a different moat

4. **Have you talked to 20 potential users?**
   - Not friends. Real humans who match ICP.
   - What did they say when comparing ChatGPT vs your concept?

---

## Recommended Path

### Week 1-2: Validation Sprint (No Code)
Run the 5 validation tests. Total: ~50 hours + $200.

### Week 3-4: Day 0 MVP (If 3+ Pass)
Build: Chat → Profile → One Action → Follow-up.

### Week 5-6: Run 30 Users Through
Measure. Interview 5 completers. Compile results.

### Week 7: Go/No-Go Decision
- If metrics hit → Build lightweight app, focus on The Walk
- If metrics miss → Pivot or kill

**Total timeline:** 7 weeks to a real decision, not 8+ months of building in the dark.

## What This Replaces

| Old Plan | New Plan |
|----------|----------|
| 8 weeks MVP | 2 weeks validation |
| Mobile app | Web chat |
| Polar star map | Text profile |
| 7-day excavation | 10-minute chat |
| HEXACO + SDT + Loevinger | "Does this feel accurate?" |
| Stripe subscription | Email capture |
| Convex + Temporal KG | Airtable |
| 173k words of ideation | One hypothesis test |

---

## The One Sentence

**Stop ideating. Start validating. If text + Day 1 + one action doesn't work, polish won't save it.**

---

*This plan intentionally makes you uncomfortable. That discomfort is the point.*
