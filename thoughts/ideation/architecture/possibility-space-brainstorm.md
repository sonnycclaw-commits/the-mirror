# Life OS: Possibility Space Brainstorm

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Purpose:** Map EVERYTHING we could build, then focus
**Stage:** Ideation - Divergent Thinking

## The Core Vision (Your Words)

> "Get asked some questions, your profile evolves - here is where we can take you on your journey. The AI maps out a pathway of incremental steps... like a map of nodes - current state and a far field goal. It's a decision tree."

**Key Differentiator from Static Profiles:**
- Dating apps fail because profiles are snapshots
- This is a LIVING profile that evolves
- The AI learns you over time
- Then it can actually NAVIGATE you somewhere

```
EACH NODE CONTAINS:
├── Current State Assessment
│   ├── Where are they on this dimension?
│   ├── What's the evidence?
│   └── Confidence level?
│
├── Available Actions
│   ├── What could they do next?
│   ├── Difficulty/effort required?
│   └── Expected impact?
│
├── Branch Conditions
│   ├── If they do X → leads to Y
│   ├── If they don't → leads to Z
│   └── Time-based decay (inaction penalty)
│
├── Blockers
│   ├── What's preventing movement?
│   ├── Internal (belief) vs External (circumstance)?
│   └── Intervention available?
│
└── Success Criteria
    ├── How do we know they've moved?
    ├── Self-report vs behavioral?

## 11. The Big Picture: Where Could This Go?

### Vision Levels

```
LEVEL 1: TRIAL APP (MVP)
─────────────────────────
• 7-day profile building
• One insight reveal
• Conversion to paid
• Basic journey (Unfuck Your Life)

LEVEL 2: JOURNEY PLATFORM
─────────────────────────
• Multiple pathways
• Skill tree system
• Continuous profile evolution
• JITAI notifications
• Shareable progress

LEVEL 3: LIFE OPERATING SYSTEM
──────────────────────────────
• All life domains
• Deep integration (calendar, wearables)
• AI that truly knows you
• Long-term decision support
• "Second brain" for self-understanding

LEVEL 4: ECOSYSTEM
──────────────────
• Coach marketplace
• Expert content
• Community features
• B2B platform
• API for other apps

LEVEL 5: INTELLIGENCE LAYER
───────────────────────────
• The "psychometric API"
• Other apps use your profile (with consent)
• Portable self-understanding
• Industry standard
```

### The Ultimate Vision

> **"The app that knows you better than you know yourself, and can actually help you become who you want to be."**

Unlike:
- **Personality tests** (static snapshot)
- **Habit apps** (behavioral only)
- **Therapy apps** (clinical focus)
- **Self-help content** (generic advice)
- **Coaching** (expensive, inconsistent)

This is:
- **Living profile** (evolves with you)
- **Psychometric + behavioral** (both)
- **Wellness + growth** (coaching-adjacent)
- **Personalized pathways** (built on YOU)
- **AI-powered** (scalable understanding)

## Next: What's In vs What's Out?

This document maps the POSSIBILITY SPACE.

Now we need to:
1. **Bucket** these into categories
2. **Prioritize** based on:
   - Core value prop
   - Technical feasibility
   - Risk level
   - Time to build
   - User demand
3. **Define** MVP scope
4. **Sequence** future releases

**Key Questions:**
- What's the MINIMUM that delivers the core value?
- What's DANGEROUS to include without more research?
- What's a DISTRACTION from the core insight?
- What COMPOUNDS over time (moat building)?
