# Deep Research Prompt: Life OS

Comprehensive research prompt covering 10 dimensions.

---

## Context

I'm developing a concept for a mobile application called "Life OS" — a time-based companion that asks users questions throughout the day, builds a living psychometric profile, and generates a personalized skill tree to guide their development.

**Core mechanic:** User starts a protocol → system prompts them at key moments (morning, midday, evening) → every response feeds a psychometric engine → over time, a comprehensive profile and skill tree emerges → system guides personalized development path.

## 1. PSYCHOMETRIC FRAMEWORKS

Research established psychometric frameworks that could inform the profiling engine:

**Personality:**
- Big Five (OCEAN), HEXACO, MBTI, Enneagram
- Empirical validity, conversational assessment methods, limitations

**Motivation:**
- Self-Determination Theory, McClelland's Needs Theory, Reiss Motivation Profile
- How to surface unconscious drivers

**Adult Development:**
- Kegan's stages, Loevinger's Ego Development, Spiral Dynamics, Cook-Greuter's framework
- Can developmental stage be assessed conversationally?

**Cognitive Style:**
- Dual process theory, decision-making patterns, learning preferences

**Behavioral Psychology:**
- Habit formation, procrastination research, self-sabotage patterns, defense mechanisms

**Positive Psychology:**
- Character strengths (VIA), flow states, well-being frameworks (PERMA)

**For each:** What's the empirical backing? How is it typically assessed? Could it be assessed through ongoing conversation? What are the criticisms?

**Also:** Identify any novel or emerging frameworks in computational psychometrics, digital phenotyping, or AI-assisted psychological assessment.

## 2. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Research existing products in adjacent spaces:

**Self-development apps:**
- Fabulous, Reflectly, Jour, Stoic, Day One
- What works, what doesn't, retention data if available

**Habit trackers:**
- Habitica, Streaks, Habit
- Gamification approaches, engagement patterns

**Coaching platforms:**
- BetterUp, CoachHub, Torch
- How do they personalize? What's their tech stack?

**AI companions:**

**Journaling apps:**
- Day One, Notion, Roam
- How do people actually use reflective tools?

**Fitness/social:**
- Strava, Peloton, Nike Run Club
- What makes their social layers work?

**For each:** What's their core mechanic? What's their retention like? What do users love/hate? What's missing?

## 3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Research technical approaches for:

**Multi-agent orchestration:**
- Agent-SDK, LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI
- Pros/cons for this use case

**Conversational AI:**
- Best practices for long-running, stateful conversations with memory

**Psychometric modeling:**
- How to build and update probabilistic user models from conversation

**Voice interaction:**
- Whisper, Deepgram, real-time transcription, emotion detection from voice

**Notification systems:**
- Optimal timing research, fatigue prevention, personalization

**Privacy architecture:**
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data, data sovereignty models, GDPR/HIPAA considerations

**Skill tree systems:**
- How do games implement skill trees? What's the data model?

**Also:** Include any relevant academic papers on computational approaches to psychological assessment or AI-assisted coaching.

## 4. INTERACTION DESIGN

Research best practices for:

**Therapeutic conversation design:**
- How do therapists structure sessions? What makes questions land?

**Micro-interactions:**
- How do successful apps use brief touchpoints effectively?

**Reflection prompts:**
- What question structures drive genuine insight vs surface responses?

**Notification UX:**
- When do notifications help vs harm? How do you earn attention?

**Longitudinal engagement:**
- How do you keep users engaged over months/years, not days?

**Voice UX:**
- Best practices for voice-first applications, especially for sensitive content

**Data visualization:**
- How do you represent a psychometric profile? A skill tree? Progress over time?

**Also:** Look for research on digital therapeutics, conversational UX, and behavior change technology.

## 5. BEHAVIOR CHANGE SCIENCE

Research the science of lasting behavior change:

**Transtheoretical Model:**
- Stages of change — how do you meet people where they are?

**Fogg Behavior Model:**
- Motivation, ability, triggers — how does this apply?

**Implementation Intentions:**
- "If-then" planning research

**Self-Determination Theory:**
- Autonomy, competence, relatedness in app design

**Habit Formation:**
- How long does it actually take? What accelerates it?

**Identity-Based Change:**
- James Clear's approach, research backing

**Accountability Research:**
- What makes accountability effective vs counterproductive?

**Key question:** What does the research say about why most self-development interventions fail? What separates interventions that work?

---

## 6. ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS

Research ethical considerations for:

**AI in mental health:**
- Guidelines, risks, regulatory landscape

**Persuasive technology ethics:**
- When does engagement become manipulation?

**Data ethics:**
- Handling deeply personal psychological data

**Therapeutic boundaries:**
- Where's the line between coaching and therapy?

**Algorithmic bias:**
- How do psychometric frameworks perform across cultures, demographics?

**Dependency risks:**
- Can an AI companion become unhealthy?

**Also:** Include any relevant guidelines from APA, ACM, or other professional bodies.
