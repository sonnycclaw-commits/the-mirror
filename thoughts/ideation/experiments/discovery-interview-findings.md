## Key Insight

The "game" isn't Habitica-style RPG. It's more like:
- **Duolingo** (micro-sessions, continuous assessment)
- **Spotify Wrapped** (you ARE the content - seeing yourself is the reward)
- **Personality tests that actually lead somewhere**

This is cleaner and more defensible than yet another habit tracker with game mechanics.
