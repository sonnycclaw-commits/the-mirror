# Dan Koe Protocol: Life OS Operationalization

**Status:** DRAFT - Exploring
**Version:** 0.2
**Date:** 2026-01-13

---

## Source Material Summary

Dan Koe's "How to fix your entire life in 1 day" provides a 3-phase protocol:

1. **Morning - Psychological Excavation** (14 questions)
   - Questions 1-10: Anti-vision creation (the life you refuse)
   - Questions 11-14: Vision creation (the life you want)

2. **Throughout Day - Pattern Interrupts** (6 scheduled + 3 bonus)
   - Scheduled reminders to break autopilot
   - Contemplation prompts

3. **Evening - Synthesis** (5 questions + goal setting)
   - Compress insights into actionable direction
   - Create game model components

---

## Two Delivery Modes

We're designing TWO distinct approaches. No assumptions about which is better.

---

# MODE A: INTENSIVE (True to Dan Koe)

## Philosophy

Dan Koe's insight: **Breakthrough happens through concentrated intensity.** The dissonance must build to a breaking point. Spreading it out may dilute the impact.

> "The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up."

This mode respects that. It's not trying to be gentle. It's trying to create transformation.

## Day 1 Conversation Flow (Intensive)

### Opening

```
AI: Before we begin, I want to be direct with you.

What we're about to do isn't comfortable. It's designed to make you
confront things you've been avoiding. Most people spend their entire
lives running from this kind of self-examination.

You're going to look at the life you're heading toward if nothing
changes. You're going to name the patterns that have been running
the show. And you're going to feel things you've been numbing.

This takes about 30-45 minutes of focused attention. No distractions.

Are you ready to do this?
```

### Anti-Vision Block (Direct Questions)

```
AI: Let's start with what you've learned to tolerate.

What is the dull, persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to live
with? Not the dramatic suffering - the quiet compromises. The things
that bother you but not enough to change.

[User responds]

AI: Now think about the last year. What do you complain about
repeatedly but never actually change? Give me three things.

[User responds]

AI: Here's the hard one. For each of those complaints - if someone
watched your actual behavior, not your words, what would they
conclude you actually want?

[User responds]

AI: What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit
to someone you deeply respect?

[User responds]

AI: Let's make this concrete. If absolutely nothing changes for the
next five years, describe an average Tuesday.

Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like? What's the
first thing you think about? Who's around you? What do you do
between 9am and 6pm? How do you feel at 10pm?

[User responds]

AI: Now extend it to ten years. What opportunities closed? Who gave
up on you? What do people say about you when you're not in the room?

[User responds]

AI: You're at the end of your life. You lived the safe version. You
never broke the pattern.

What was the cost? What did you never let yourself feel, try, or
become?

[User responds]

AI: Who in your life is already living the future you just described?
Someone five, ten, twenty years ahead on the same trajectory. What
do you feel when you think about becoming them?

[User responds]

AI: If your current behavior is a form of self-protection, what
exactly are you protecting? And what is that protection costing you?

[User responds]

AI: Last one for this section, and it's the one most people dodge.

What is the most embarrassing reason you haven't changed? The one
that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than reasonable.

[User responds]
```

### Vision Block (Direct Questions)

```
AI: You've looked at what you're running from. Now let's look at
what you're running toward.

Forget practicality for a minute. If you could snap your fingers
and be living a different life in three years - not what's
realistic, what you actually want - what does an average Tuesday
look like?

Same level of detail. Where, who, what, how it feels.

[User responds]

AI: What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to
feel natural rather than forced?

Complete this: "I am the type of person who..."

[User responds]

AI: What is one thing you would do THIS WEEK if you were already
that person?

[User responds]
```

### Pattern Interrupts (Push Notifications)

Delivered throughout Day 1 at scheduled times. User responds in-app.

```
[11:00am]
What am I avoiding right now by doing what I'm doing?

[1:30pm]
If someone filmed the last two hours, what would they conclude
I want from my life?

[3:15pm]
Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?

[5:00pm]
What's the most important thing I'm pretending isn't important?

[7:30pm]
What did I do today out of identity protection rather than
genuine desire?

[9:00pm]
When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most dead?
```

### Evening Synthesis

```
AI: You've done the hard work today. Let's lock it in.

After everything you explored - what feels most true about why
you've been stuck?

[User responds]

AI: Name the actual enemy. Not circumstances. Not other people.
The internal pattern or belief that's been running the show.

[User responds]

AI: Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let
your life become. This is your anti-vision compressed.

[User responds]

AI: Now write a single sentence for what you're building toward.
It will evolve, but start here.

[User responds]

AI: Final piece. Goals as lenses, not finish lines.

One-year lens: What would have to be true in one year for you to
know you've broken the old pattern?

[User responds]

AI: One-month lens: What would have to be true in one month for
the one-year lens to remain possible?

[User responds]

AI: Daily lens: What are 2-3 actions you'll do tomorrow that the
person you're becoming would simply do?

[User responds]
```

### Game Model Delivery

```
AI: Here's your game.

│ "[What you won't sacrifice]"                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

This is your operating system now. Every decision filters through
this. When you're tempted to fall back into old patterns, you
look at your anti-vision and remember what's at stake.

# MODE B: DISTRIBUTED (Accumulation-Based)

## Philosophy

Alternative hypothesis: **Breakthrough happens through accumulated evidence.** The user needs to SEE their patterns reflected back before they can admit them. Trust must be earned before hard questions land.

This mode builds the case day by day until the conclusion is undeniable.

## Day-by-Day Conversation Flows (Distributed)

### Day 1: First Contact

**Goal:** Establish safety, begin baseline extraction

**Questions woven in:** None from Dan Koe directly

```
AI: Hey. I'm glad you're here.

I'm not going to ask you to set goals or make resolutions. That
usually doesn't work anyway.

Instead, I want to understand where you actually are. Not where
you think you should be. Not what sounds good. Where you are.

So let's start simple: What brought you here today?

[User responds]

AI: [Acknowledge, reflect back]

What's one thing about your life right now that you'd like to
be different? Doesn't have to be dramatic.

[User responds]

AI: [Extract signals, note emotional tone]

Walk me through yesterday. Not the highlight reel - the actual
day. When did you wake up, what did you do, how did it feel?

[User responds]

AI: Thanks for sharing that. I'm starting to get a picture.

We'll talk more tomorrow. Between now and then, I want you to
notice one thing: when do you feel most like yourself, and when
do you feel like you're performing?

[End session]
```

**Extraction targets:**
- Engagement style
- Baseline emotional state
- Initial dissatisfaction signals
- SDT need hints

### Day 2: Pattern Seeds

**Goal:** Introduce dissatisfaction awareness, plant pattern concept

**Dan Koe questions:** Q1, Q2

```
AI: Welcome back. How was yesterday after we talked?

[User responds]

AI: I want to dig into something today.

What is the dull, persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to
live with? I'm not talking about the big dramatic problems. I
mean the quiet compromises. The things that bother you but not
quite enough to change.

[User responds]

AI: [Reflect, extract]

Think about the past year. What do you complain about repeatedly
but never actually change?

Give me three things.

[User responds]

AI: [Note patterns, don't reveal yet]

There's something I want you to sit with tonight. You mentioned
[pattern hint from extraction]. Pay attention to when that shows
up in the next 24 hours.

[End session]
```

**Extraction targets:**
- Conscious dissatisfaction
- Complaint patterns
- Gap between stated and actual priorities

### Day 3: First Reflection

**Goal:** First pattern reveal, create "you noticed that" moment

**Dan Koe questions:** Q3

```
AI: Before we dive in - did you notice [pattern from Day 2]
showing up yesterday?

[User responds]

AI: Here's something I've been thinking about since we talked.

You mentioned [complaint from Day 2]. But looking at what you
described about your days... if someone watched your actual
behavior - not your words - what would they conclude you
actually want?

[User responds]

AI: I noticed something across our conversations.

[Pattern reveal - specific, with evidence]

You say you want [stated desire], but there's a pattern where
[observed behavior]. It's like part of you is working toward
something different than what you say you want.

Does that land?

[User responds - this is the "you noticed that" moment]

AI: [Validate or adjust based on response]

We're going to go deeper tomorrow. The questions get harder.
But you're ready.

[End session]
```

**Extraction targets:**
- Behavior vs stated preference gap
- Response to being seen accurately
- Emotional engagement level

### Day 4: Anti-Vision Territory

**Goal:** Enter uncomfortable territory, gather anti-vision raw material

**Dan Koe questions:** Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7

```
AI: Today we go somewhere uncomfortable. That's intentional.

What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit
to someone you deeply respect?

[User responds]

AI: Let's make this concrete.

If absolutely nothing changes for the next five years, describe
an average Tuesday.

Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like? What's the
first thing you think about? Who's around you? What do you do
between 9am and 6pm? How do you feel at 10pm?

[User responds]

AI: Now extend it. Ten years.

What opportunities closed? Who gave up on you? What do people
say about you when you're not in the room?

[User responds]

AI: You're at the end of your life. You lived the safe version.
You never broke the pattern.

What was the cost? What did you never let yourself feel, try,
or become?

[User responds]

AI: Sit with that tonight. We're not done yet.

[End session]
```

**Extraction targets:**
- Anti-vision raw material
- Core fears
- What they're protecting
- Emotional depth reached

### Day 5: Breakthrough

**Goal:** Crystallize anti-vision, deliver major insight

**Dan Koe questions:** Q8, Q9, Q10

```
AI: How are you feeling after yesterday?

[User responds - check for crisis signals]

AI: We're going to finish what we started.

Who in your life is already living the future you described
yesterday? Someone five, ten, twenty years ahead on the same
trajectory.

What do you feel when you think about becoming them?

[User responds]

AI: What identity would you have to give up to actually change?

"I am the type of person who..." - what would have to die for
you to become someone new?

[User responds]

AI: Last one. And this is the one most people dodge.

What is the most embarrassing reason you haven't changed? The
one that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than
reasonable.

[User responds]

AI: [Major insight delivery]

Here's what I see.

[Synthesize everything into crystallized anti-vision]

Your anti-vision isn't just [surface fear]. It's [deeper pattern].

You've been protecting [identity/safety] at the cost of [what
they actually want].

The pattern running the show is [named pattern].

[Pause for impact]

Tomorrow, we look at what you actually want. The real thing.

[End session]
```

**Extraction targets:**
- Anti-vision crystallization
- Core pattern named
- Breakthrough moment captured
- Response to major insight

### Day 6: Vision Building

**Goal:** Channel dissonance into positive direction

**Dan Koe questions:** Q11, Q12, Q13

```
AI: Yesterday was heavy. How are you sitting with it?

[User responds]

AI: You've looked at what you're running from. Now let's look
at what you're running toward.

Forget practicality. If you could snap your fingers and be
living a different life in three years - not what's realistic,
what you actually want - what does an average Tuesday look like?

Same level of detail.

[User responds]

AI: What would you have to believe about yourself for that life
to feel natural rather than forced?

Complete this: "I am the type of person who..."

[User responds]

AI: What is one thing you would do THIS WEEK if you were already
that person?

[User responds]

AI: We're almost there. Tomorrow we put it all together.

[End session]
```

**Extraction targets:**
- Vision raw material
- Identity statement
- Immediate action possibility
- Momentum and energy level

### Day 7: Synthesis + Conversion

**Goal:** Deliver full profile, game model, convert

**Dan Koe questions:** Synthesis set

```
AI: This is it. Let's lock everything in.

After this week - what feels most true about why you've been
stuck?

[User responds]

AI: Name the actual enemy. Not circumstances. Not other people.
The internal pattern or belief that's been running the show.

[User responds]

AI: Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let
your life become.

[User responds]

AI: Now write a single sentence for what you're building toward.

[User responds]

AI: One-year lens: What would have to be true in one year for
you to know you've broken the old pattern?

[User responds]

AI: One-month lens: What would have to be true in one month for
that to remain possible?

[User responds]

AI: Daily lens: What 2-3 actions would the person you're becoming
simply do?

[User responds]

[Full profile reveal + game model delivery]

AI: Here's everything we've built this week.

[Display full profile with all extracted patterns, insights,
anti-vision, vision, and game model]

This isn't just information about you. It's an operating system.

Ready to start playing?

## Comparison: Intensive vs Distributed

| Dimension | Intensive | Distributed |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Time to breakthrough** | Day 1 | Day 5 |
| **Question delivery** | All at once | Spread across days |
| **Trust building** | Assumed/earned through intensity | Built incrementally |
| **Pattern reveals** | End of Day 1 | Days 3, 5, 7 |
| **Dropout risk** | High on Day 1, low after | Gradual throughout |
| **Emotional intensity** | Peak Day 1 | Builds to Day 5 peak |
| **User commitment** | High upfront investment | Lower daily investment |
| **Profile completeness** | Full on Day 1 | Builds over 7 days |
| **Best for** | High-agency users ready for change | Users who need evidence |

---

## Open Questions

### Mode Selection
1. Do we let users choose their mode?
2. Do we assess readiness and route automatically?
3. Do we A/B test to see which converts better?

### Hybrid Possibilities
4. Could Day 1 be intensive, then Days 2-7 be journey?
5. Could we offer "deep dive" option on any day?

### Validation
6. How do we know which mode creates deeper change (not just conversion)?
7. What signals indicate a user should switch modes?

---

# EXPLORATION A: Day 1 Intensive Openers

Testing different approaches to the intensive mode opening. What lands vs pushes away?

## Opener Variants

### Variant 1: Direct Challenge (Original)

```
AI: Before we begin, I want to be direct with you.

What we're about to do isn't comfortable. It's designed to make you
confront things you've been avoiding. Most people spend their entire
lives running from this kind of self-examination.

You're going to look at the life you're heading toward if nothing
changes. You're going to name the patterns that have been running
the show. And you're going to feel things you've been numbing.

This takes about 30-45 minutes of focused attention. No distractions.

Are you ready to do this?
```

**Tone:** Challenging, no-nonsense
**Assumption:** User is ready, needs permission to go deep
**Risk:** May feel aggressive, push away uncertain users
**Reward:** Filters for committed users, sets expectations

---

### Variant 2: Invitation to Depth

```
AI: Most apps ask you to set goals. We're going to do something
different.

We're going to look at why you haven't already become the person
you want to be. That means going somewhere uncomfortable.

I'm going to ask you questions most people spend their whole lives
avoiding. About the life you're actually heading toward. About
what's really been holding you back.

This isn't casual. It takes about 30-45 minutes of real focus.

Want to go there?
```

**Tone:** Inviting but clear about stakes
**Assumption:** User needs to understand value proposition first
**Risk:** Softer frame may not create breakthrough conditions
**Reward:** More accessible while still setting up intensity

---

### Variant 3: Contrast Frame

```
AI: There are two ways we can do this.

The easy way: We talk about your goals, I give you some tips, you
feel good for a day and nothing changes.

The hard way: We dig into why you've been stuck. We look at the
life you're heading toward if nothing changes. We name the patterns
you've been running from. It's uncomfortable. It takes about 45
minutes. And it actually works.

Which one?
```

**Tone:** Binary choice, puts user in control
**Assumption:** User needs to actively choose difficulty
**Risk:** Some users might choose "easy" (do we even offer it?)
**Reward:** Self-selection creates commitment

---

### Variant 4: Dan Koe Quote Lead

```
AI: "You aren't where you want to be because you aren't the person
who would be there."

That's the starting point. Not goals. Not motivation. Identity.

For the next 45 minutes, we're going to excavate who you actually
are - not who you think you are, not who you present to others.
We're going to look at the life you're sleepwalking toward and
the patterns that have been running the show.

This isn't comfortable. That's the point.

Ready?
```

**Tone:** Philosophical, frames the work
**Assumption:** User responds to ideas/frameworks
**Risk:** May feel too abstract for some
**Reward:** Establishes intellectual framework for the work

---

### Variant 5: No Preamble (Straight In)

```
AI: What is the dull, persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to
live with?

Not the dramatic suffering. The quiet compromises. The things that
bother you but not enough to change.
```

**Tone:** Immediate, no setup
**Assumption:** User already committed by opening app
**Risk:** Jarring, no context
**Reward:** Respects user's time, doesn't over-explain

---

### Variant 6: Stakes First

```
AI: If absolutely nothing changes about your life for the next ten
years, what do you lose?

Not what stays the same. What do you miss? Who gives up on you?
What do people say about you when you're not in the room?

[User responds]

AI: That's what we're here to prevent.

For the next 45 minutes, we're going to build a clear picture of
that future - and the one you actually want. Then we're going to
figure out why you've been heading toward the wrong one.

Let's go.
```

**Tone:** Starts with consequence, builds to framework
**Assumption:** User needs to feel stakes before committing
**Risk:** May trigger anxiety before trust is built
**Reward:** Immediate emotional engagement

---

## Opener Comparison Matrix

| Variant | Emotional Entry | Commitment Ask | Control Given | Filter Strength |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1. Direct Challenge | Medium-high | Explicit | Low | High |
| 2. Invitation | Medium | Explicit | Medium | Medium |
| 3. Contrast Frame | Low | Explicit choice | High | High |
| 4. Quote Lead | Medium | Implicit | Low | Medium |
| 5. No Preamble | High (jarring) | None | None | Very high |
| 6. Stakes First | High | Implicit then explicit | Low | High |

## Open Questions

- Do we need to filter users, or do we want everyone to attempt intensive?
- Does the opener affect completion rate or just who starts?
- Should opener vary based on acquisition channel? (Ad vs organic vs referral)
- Is there value in asking WHY they're here before diving in?

---

# EXPLORATION B: Question → Extraction Target Mapping

Each of Dan Koe's 14 questions serves a purpose. What signal does each give us?

## Anti-Vision Questions (1-10)

### Q1: Dull Persistent Dissatisfaction

```
"What is the dull, persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to
live with? Not the dramatic suffering - the quiet compromises."
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| SDT Needs | Which needs are chronically unmet (autonomy, competence, relatedness) |
| Tolerance Patterns | What they've normalized that shouldn't be normal |
| Emotional Baseline | Current dissatisfaction level (for tracking change) |
| Life Domains | Where the pain lives (work, relationships, health, self) |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "I guess just... feeling like I'm going through the motions.
Work is fine but not exciting. My relationship is stable but we're
more like roommates. I exercise but I don't really feel healthy."

→ SDT: Low competence (no mastery), low relatedness (roommates)
→ Domains: Work, relationships, health all affected
→ Pattern: "Fine but not..." = settling pattern
→ Emotional baseline: Moderate dissatisfaction, low urgency
```

---

### Q2: Repeated Complaints Never Changed

```
"What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change?
Give me three things."
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Stated vs Actual Gap | What they SAY they want vs don't pursue |
| Complaint Domains | Specific areas of friction |
| Inaction Patterns | Where they're stuck |
| Social Performance | What they present to others as problems |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "1. My job - I keep saying I'll look for something better
2. My weight - always starting diets then stopping
3. Not having enough time for myself"

→ Complaint domains: Career, health, autonomy
→ Inaction pattern: Start-stop cycles (weight), avoidance (job)
→ Social performance: "Not enough time" = socially acceptable excuse
```

---

### Q3: What Behavior Reveals

```
"For each complaint - if someone watched your actual behavior,
not your words, what would they conclude you actually want?"
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Unconscious Goals | What they're actually optimizing for |
| Self-Awareness Level | Can they see the gap? |
| Defenses | How they justify the gap |
| Core Fears | What the behavior protects |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "I guess they'd think I want... safety? Comfort? Like I
complain about my job but I never apply anywhere. Maybe I'm
scared of rejection. Or scared of actually getting something
better and having to perform."

→ Unconscious goal: Safety, predictability
→ Self-awareness: High - can articulate the gap
→ Core fear: Rejection, being exposed as inadequate
→ Defense pattern: Complaint without action = safety maintenance
```

---

### Q4: Unbearable Truth

```
"What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit
to someone you deeply respect?"
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Shame Core | Deepest point of self-judgment |
| Identity Threat | What would shatter their self-image |
| Social Mask | Gap between presented and actual self |
| Vulnerability Level | Willingness to be honest |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "That I've wasted ten years. That I had potential and I
let fear win. That the person I present to everyone - confident,
together - is mostly performance."

→ Shame core: Wasted potential, being a fraud
→ Identity threat: "Confident person" mask at risk
→ Social mask: High gap between presented and felt self
→ Vulnerability: High - willing to go here
```

---

### Q5: 5-Year Tuesday

```
"If absolutely nothing changes for the next five years, describe
an average Tuesday. Where, who, what, how it feels."
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Anti-Vision Raw | Concrete feared future |
| Key Details | What specifically they fear (loneliness, stagnation, etc.) |
| Emotional Weight | How much this scares them |
| Projection Accuracy | How realistic vs catastrophic |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "Wake up at 6:30, alone probably. Same apartment. Drag
myself to the same job. Meetings about nothing. Come home, scroll
phone, fall asleep watching something. Feel nothing. Just...
existing."

→ Anti-vision elements: Alone, same job, nothing meaningful, numbing
→ Core fears: Loneliness, stagnation, meaninglessness
→ Emotional weight: Heavy - "feel nothing" = deep fear
→ Key detail: "Existing" vs living
```

---

### Q6: 10-Year Extension

```
"Now extend it to ten years. What opportunities closed? Who gave
up on you? What do people say about you when you're not in the room?"
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Social Fear | What others think matters deeply |
| Loss Awareness | What they know they'll regret |
| Relationship Fears | Who they're afraid of losing/disappointing |
| Legacy Concerns | How they want to be remembered |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "In ten years... I'd be 45. Probably still single. My
friends would have families. They'd pity me. Say 'he had so
much potential' or 'I don't know what happened to him.' My
parents would worry about me until they died."

→ Social fear: Pity, being left behind
→ Loss: Potential, family, peer belonging
→ Relationship fears: Disappointing parents, losing friends
→ Legacy: "Had potential" = worst epitaph
```

---

### Q7: End of Life - Safe Version

```
"You're at the end of your life. You lived the safe version.
What was the cost? What did you never let yourself feel, try,
or become?"
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Deepest Regret | What they truly want but won't pursue |
| Unlived Life | The person they could have been |
| Core Desires | Often hidden behind "realistic" goals |
| Mortality Salience | Does death perspective create urgency? |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "I never let myself really go for something. Never took
the risk to build something of my own. Never felt truly known
by someone because I never dropped the mask. I played it safe
and got a safe life. Which is no life at all."

→ Unlived life: Entrepreneur/creator, deep intimacy
→ Core desires: Autonomy (own thing), relatedness (being known)
→ Cost of safety: Everything that matters
→ Key phrase: "safe life = no life" - high readiness signal
```

---

### Q8: Who's Living Your Feared Future

```
"Who in your life is already living the future you just described?
Someone five, ten, twenty years ahead on the same trajectory."
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Concrete Warning | Makes abstract future real |
| Emotional Charge | How they feel about becoming this person |
| Denial Check | Do they resist the comparison? |
| Trajectory Awareness | Can they see themselves in others? |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "My uncle. He's 55, never married, works a job he hates,
drinks too much on weekends, and just... waits. Waits for
retirement, waits for something to happen. Everyone feels sorry
for him but no one says it. God, I don't want to be him."

→ Concrete model: Uncle = 20-year projection
→ Emotional charge: High disgust/fear
→ Key elements: Waiting, passivity, pity
→ Readiness signal: "I don't want to be him" = motivation fuel
```

---

### Q9: Identity to Give Up

```
"What identity would you have to give up to actually change?
'I am the type of person who...' - what would have to die?"
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Protective Identity | What self-concept they're defending |
| Change Barrier | What specifically blocks transformation |
| Ego Investment | How attached to current identity |
| Growth Edge | Where the work needs to happen |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "'I am the type of person who plays it safe.' 'Who doesn't
rock the boat.' 'Who keeps everyone comfortable.' I'd have to
give up being the reliable, stable, non-threatening guy. Being
liked by everyone. Being seen as 'together.'"

→ Protective identity: Safe, likeable, stable
→ Change barrier: Fear of being disliked, seen as unstable
→ Ego investment: High in "together" image
→ Growth edge: Needs to tolerate discomfort, risk disapproval
```

---

### Q10: Most Embarrassing Reason

```
"What is the most embarrassing reason you haven't changed? The
one that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than reasonable."
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Core Block | The real obstacle (not the rationalization) |
| Shame Layer | Where vulnerability lives |
| Honesty Level | Can they drop defenses? |
| Breakthrough Readiness | Admission = halfway to breakthrough |

**Example Extraction:**
```
User: "I'm scared. That's it. Not 'I don't have time' or 'the
economy' or whatever. I'm scared that if I try and fail, I'll
have to face that I'm not as smart or capable as I think I am.
Easier to not try and keep the fantasy."

→ Core block: Fear of confirmed inadequacy
→ Shame: Being exposed as ordinary
→ Honesty: Very high - no rationalization
→ Pattern: Avoidance protects self-image
→ Breakthrough signal: Naming it = power begins to break
```

---

## Vision Questions (11-14)

### Q11: 3-Year Ideal Tuesday

```
"Forget practicality. If you could snap your fingers and be living
a different life in three years - not what's realistic, what you
actually want - what does an average Tuesday look like?"
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Vision Raw | Concrete desired future |
| Core Values | What they actually prioritize (revealed, not stated) |
| SDT Alignment | Which needs are emphasized |
| Specificity Level | How clear is their vision? |

---

### Q12: Identity Statement

```
"What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to
feel natural? Complete: 'I am the type of person who...'"
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Target Identity | Who they need to become |
| Belief Gap | Current beliefs vs required beliefs |
| Identity Delta | Distance from current to target |

---

### Q13: One Action This Week

```
"What is one thing you would do THIS WEEK if you were already
that person?"
```

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Action Readiness | Can they translate insight to behavior? |
| Barrier Test | What stops them from doing it now? |
| Commitment Level | Will they actually do it? |

---

### Q14: Synthesis (Vision MVP)

This emerges from the previous three - not a direct question.

**Extracts:**
| Signal Type | What We Learn |
|-------------|---------------|
| Vision Clarity | How coherent is their direction? |
| Integration | Did anti-vision and vision connect? |

---

## Extraction Summary Table

| Question | Primary Signal | Secondary Signals | Breakthrough Potential |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Q1 | SDT needs | Domains, baseline | Low |
| Q2 | Stated/actual gap | Complaint patterns | Low |
| Q3 | Unconscious goals | Self-awareness, fears | Medium |
| Q4 | Shame core | Identity threat, masks | High |

# EXPLORATION C: Mode Selection Design

How do we determine which mode (Intensive vs Distributed) fits a user?

## Option 1: User Chooses

### Simple Binary

```
AI: There are two ways to do this.

DEEP DIVE (45 minutes)
Go through everything today. Intense but complete.

DAILY JOURNEY (7 days)
Build gradually, one conversation per day.

Which fits you better right now?
```

**Pros:**
- Respects user agency
- Self-selection may improve completion
- Simple to implement

**Cons:**
- Users may not know what they need
- May choose "easy" when they need "hard"
- No personalization

---

### Framed Choice

```
AI: Quick question before we start.

When you need to make a change, do you tend to:

A) Rip off the bandaid - face it all at once, get it over with
B) Take it step by step - build up to the hard parts

[User selects]

AI: Got it. We'll go [intensive/distributed].
```

**Pros:**
- Frames choice in user's self-knowledge
- Maps to real personality difference
- Still gives agency

**Cons:**
- Users may not self-assess accurately
- Bandaid-rippers might still churn on Day 1

---

## Option 2: Readiness Assessment

### Quick Probe

```
AI: Before we dive in, I want to understand where you're at.

On a scale of 1-10, how fed up are you with your current situation?

[User: 8]

AI: And when you think about making a real change - not just
talking about it - what's the first feeling that comes up?

[User: Excitement / Fear / Exhaustion / Skepticism]

AI: Last one. If I told you we could get complete clarity on
what's been holding you back in the next 45 minutes, would you
make that time right now?

[User: Yes / No / Maybe]
```

**Routing Logic:**
| Fed Up Score | Feeling | Time Available | Route To |
|--------------|---------|----------------|----------|
| 7-10 | Excitement | Yes | Intensive |
| 7-10 | Fear | Yes | Intensive (with support framing) |
| 7-10 | Any | No | Distributed |
| 4-6 | Any | Any | Distributed |
| 1-3 | Any | Any | Distributed (or different product?) |

---

### Behavioral Assessment

Don't ask - observe.

**Day 0 signals:**
- Time spent on onboarding (rushed vs careful)
- Response length (verbose vs terse)
- Emotional language (present vs absent)
- Time of day (morning = more energy)
- Referral source (Dan Koe audience vs random ad)

**Route based on:**
| Signal | Intensive Indicator | Distributed Indicator |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Response length | Long, detailed | Short, guarded |
| Emotional words | Present, intense | Absent, clinical |
| Time investment | Willing to spend time | Wants quick |
| Energy level | High, urgent | Low, exploratory |

---

## Option 3: Adaptive Start

Begin same for everyone, adapt based on engagement.

### First Question Test

```
AI: What is the dull, persistent dissatisfaction you've learned
to live with?

[Observe response]
```

**If response is:**
- **Long, vulnerable, specific** → Route to Intensive
- **Short, guarded, vague** → Route to Distributed
- **Deflecting, joking** → Route to Distributed with rapport focus

---

### Escalation Test

```
Day 1, Question 3:

AI: Here's the hard one. For each of those complaints - if someone
watched your actual behavior, not your words, what would they
conclude you actually want?

[Observe response]
```

**If they engage deeply** → "Want to keep going? We can do the full excavation today."
**If they deflect/shorten** → "Let's sit with that. We'll pick up tomorrow."

---

## Option 4: No Selection - Everyone Gets Intensive

Hypothesis: The Distributed mode is a safety net we don't need.

**Arguments for:**
- Dan Koe's protocol works as designed
- Filtering happens naturally (uncommitted users churn)
- Distributed may just delay inevitable dropout
- Building for the committed user is a valid strategy

**Arguments against:**
- App economics need retention
- Not everyone is Dan Koe's audience
- Some users genuinely need accumulation
- Churn on Day 1 = no conversion opportunity

---

## Mode Selection Matrix

| Selection Method | Personalization | User Agency | Implementation Complexity |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| User chooses (simple) | Low | High | Low |
| User chooses (framed) | Medium | High | Low |
| Readiness assessment | High | Medium | Medium |
| Behavioral observation | High | Low | High |
| Adaptive start | High | Medium | Medium |
| No selection (intensive only) | None | None | Low |

## Open Questions

- Is mode selection actually important, or should we pick one and commit?
- What data would tell us which approach is better?
- Could we A/B test and let the market decide?
- Is "readiness" even measurable, or is it revealed through action?

---

# EXPLORATION D: Journey Mode Design (Days 2-7 Post-Intensive)

If users complete the full protocol on Day 1, what are Days 2-7 for?

## The Challenge

In Intensive Mode:
- Day 1: Full excavation, anti-vision, vision, game model
- Day 2-7: ???

User already has:
- Crystallized anti-vision
- Vision MVP
- Named patterns
- Game model (6 components)
- Daily levers identified

## Option 1: Execution Support

Days 2-7 focus on DOING, not discovering.

### Structure

```
DAY 2: First Lever Check-In
═══════════════════════════

Morning:
AI: You identified these as your daily levers yesterday:
• [Lever 1]
• [Lever 2]
• [Lever 3]

Today's focus: Just [Lever 1]. Nothing else.

What's your plan for making that happen today?

[User responds]

Evening:
AI: How did it go with [Lever 1]?

[User responds]

AI: [Reflect on what worked/didn't]

What did you notice about yourself when you [did/didn't] do it?
```

### Day-by-Day Focus

| Day | Focus | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 2 | First lever only | Build micro-success |
| 3 | Second lever | Expand capacity |
| 4 | All levers | Full daily practice |
| 5 | Pattern interrupt review | What did you notice this week? |
| 6 | Obstacle excavation | What got in the way? Why? |
| 7 | Weekly calibration | Adjust levers, reconnect to vision |

---

## Option 2: Deepening

Days 2-7 go DEEPER into specific areas from Day 1.

### Structure

```
DAY 2: Anti-Vision Deepening
════════════════════════════

AI: Yesterday you named your anti-vision:
"[User's anti-vision sentence]"

Today I want to understand it better.

You mentioned [specific element]. Let's go there.

What specifically about [element] scares you most?

[Deeper excavation into one aspect]
```

### Day-by-Day Depth

| Day | Depth Focus | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| 2 | Anti-vision specifics | Make the fear visceral |
| 3 | Pattern origin | Where did this pattern start? |
| 4 | Identity archaeology | Who taught you to be this way? |
| 5 | Vision specifics | Make the desire visceral |
| 6 | Blocker excavation | What specifically will stop you? |
| 7 | Commitment ceremony | Lock in the transformation |

---

## Option 3: Pattern Interrupts Focus

Days 2-7 are primarily about the INTERRUPT practice.

### Structure

```
DAY 2: Interrupt Training
═════════════════════════

AI: Today you'll get 6 interrupts throughout the day.

Each one is a moment to check: Am I moving toward my vision
or my anti-vision right now?

Your anti-vision: [sentence]
Your vision: [sentence]

First interrupt coming at 11am. Stay alert.

[Throughout day: Push notifications with questions]

Evening:
AI: How many times today did you catch yourself on autopilot?

What did you notice?
```

### Interrupt Escalation

| Day | Interrupt Focus |
|-----|-----------------|
| 2 | Awareness building - "What am I avoiding?" |
| 3 | Behavior tracking - "What would observer conclude?" |
| 4 | Direction check - "Toward vision or anti-vision?" |
| 5 | Identity alignment - "What did I do from identity protection?" |
| 6 | Aliveness audit - "When most alive? Most dead?" |

## Option 4: Skill Building

Days 2-7 introduce skills from the skill tree based on patterns detected.

### Structure

```
DAY 2: First Skill Introduction
═══════════════════════════════

AI: Based on what you shared yesterday, there's a skill that
would directly address your pattern of [pattern].

It's called: [Skill name]

Here's how it works...

[Skill teaching]

Today's practice: [Micro-exercise]
```

### Skill Mapping

| Detected Pattern | Introduced Skill |
|------------------|------------------|
| Avoidance | Discomfort Tolerance |
| People-pleasing | Boundary Setting |
| Perfectionism | Good Enough Practice |
| Procrastination | Activation Energy |
| Rumination | Present Anchoring |
| Comparison | Self-Referential Goals |

## Option 5: Hybrid Journey

Combine elements based on what Day 1 revealed.

### Structure

```
DAY 2-7 PERSONALIZED:

Based on Day 1 profile:
- Primary pattern: [X]
- Core fear: [Y]
- Readiness level: [Z]

Day 2-7 plan:
- Days 2-3: Execution support (levers)
- Day 4: Deep dive on primary pattern
- Day 5: Skill introduction for pattern
- Day 6: Interrupt integration
- Day 7: Calibration + conversion
```

## Journey Mode Comparison

| Option | Focus | Value Proposition | Conversion Hook |
|--------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Execution Support | Doing | "Help staying on track" | Daily accountability |
| Deepening | Understanding | "Go even deeper" | Continued excavation |
| Pattern Interrupts | Awareness | "Stay conscious" | Notification system |
| Skill Building | Capability | "Learn how to change" | Skill library access |
| Hybrid | Personalized | "Custom journey" | Full system access |

## Open Questions

- What creates more value: doing or understanding?
- Is Day 1 enough transformation, or do users need continued excavation?
- Do users want to be LEFT ALONE after Day 1 to execute, or accompanied?
- What's the minimum viable post-intensive journey?

| Journey content | Structured transformation path |

### Conversion Psychology

**User mindset at conversion:**
- Just had intense experience
- Has complete clarity
- Feels urgency to act
- Knows exactly what they need to do
- May feel "I can do this alone now"

**Challenge:** They have the MAP. Why pay for the GUIDE?

**Counter-argument:**
- Knowing and doing are different
- Accountability matters
- Patterns will pull them back
- Skills require teaching

### Conversion Copy Options

**Option A: Accountability Frame**
```
AI: You have the clarity now. That's the easy part.

The hard part is the next 30 days. The patterns will fight back.
The anti-vision will start to feel distant. The urgency will fade.

That's where I come in.

Daily check-ins. Pattern interrupts. Skill building. Progress
tracking. A companion who knows your patterns and won't let you
sleepwalk back into them.

Ready to start the journey?

[Unlock: $X/month]
```

**Option B: Skill Frame**
```
AI: You know WHAT to do now. But do you know HOW?

[Pattern] requires specific skills to overcome. The next 30 days,
I'll teach you:

• [Skill 1] - for when [trigger]
• [Skill 2] - for when [trigger]
• [Skill 3] - for when [trigger]

Plus daily practice, progress tracking, and a companion who
sees your patterns before you do.

[Unlock: $X/month]
```

**Option C: Stakes Frame**
```
AI: Here's your anti-vision again:

"[Their anti-vision sentence]"

That's what's at stake.

You can try to change alone. Most people do. Most people fail.

Or you can have a system that keeps your vision in front of you,
interrupts your autopilot, and builds the skills to actually
become the person you saw today.

## Conversion Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Intensive | Distributed |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Conversion point** | Day 1 evening | Day 7 |
| **User state** | Peak intensity, clarity | Building curiosity |
| **What's gated** | Ongoing support | Full reveal + support |
| **Urgency level** | High (just had breakthrough) | Medium (want completion) |
| **FOMO type** | "I'll lose momentum" | "I want to see everything" |
| **Value proven** | Fully (got the experience) | Partially (got taste) |
| **Risk** | "I can do this alone" | "Haven't gotten enough yet" |

## Pricing Considerations

| Model | Suggested Price | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Intensive | Higher ($25-30/mo) | Full value delivered, paying for support |
| Distributed | Lower ($15-20/mo) | Value delivered gradually, lower commitment feel |
| Single tier | $20/mo | Simplicity, A/B test later |

## Open Questions

- Is the Intensive conversion actually harder because they already got the value?
- Does Distributed create stronger lock-in through relationship building?
- Should pricing differ by mode?
- What's the trial-to-paid conversion rate benchmark we're targeting?
- Could there be a "Day 1 only" product? (Pay $X for the intensive experience, no subscription)

---

## Overall Open Questions Across All Explorations

### Product Strategy
1. Should we ship BOTH modes and let data decide?
2. Is there a hybrid that gets benefits of both?
3. What's the minimum viable first version?

### Testing Strategy
4. How do we test openers without full app?
5. Can we prototype the intensive Day 1 as a standalone experience?
6. What metrics matter most? (Completion? Conversion? Retention? Transformation?)

### Unique Considerations
7. Dan Koe's audience vs general audience - same product?
8. Is "transformation" measurable? How do we know it worked?
9. What's the competitive moat - the protocol or the AI delivery?

**Dan Koe questions to weave in:**
- None directly - too early

**Instead, explore:**
- What brought you here?
- What's one thing you'd like to be different?
- What does a typical day look like for you?

**Extraction targets:**
- Engagement style (verbose vs terse)
- Initial dissatisfaction signals
- Emotional baseline

**End state:** User feels heard, curious about what's next

---

### Day 2: Building Rapport (Pattern Introduction)

**Goal:** Introduce the idea that patterns exist, plant seeds

**Dan Koe questions to weave in:**
- Q1 (light version): "What's something you've gotten used to that you wish was different?"
- Q2 (light version): "What do you find yourself complaining about?"

**Extraction targets:**
- Surface-level dissatisfaction
- Complaint patterns
- SDT need signals (what's missing?)

**End state:** User starts noticing their own patterns

---

### Day 3: Pattern Recognition (First Insight)

**Goal:** Reflect back a pattern, create first "you noticed that?!" moment

**Dan Koe questions to weave in:**
- Q3: "Looking at what you've shared... what would someone conclude you actually want?"
- Q4 (if trust established): "Is there something about your current situation that's hard to admit?"

**Extraction targets:**
- Behavioral vs stated preferences gap
- First pattern confirmation
- Emotional response to being seen

**Insight delivery:** First pattern reveal based on Days 1-2 extraction

**End state:** User feels genuinely understood

---

### Day 4: Going Deeper (Emotional Territory)

**Goal:** Enter anti-vision territory, escalate intensity

**Dan Koe questions to weave in:**
- Q5: "If nothing changes for 5 years, what does a typical Tuesday look like?"
- Q6: "What about 10 years? What have you missed?"
- Q7: "At the end, living the safe version... what was the cost?"

**Extraction targets:**
- Anti-vision raw material
- Core fears
- What they're protecting

**Safety check:** Monitor for crisis signals, provide off-ramp

**End state:** User feels the weight of inaction

---

### Day 5: First Reveal (Major Aha Moment)

**Goal:** Synthesize everything into a powerful insight

**Dan Koe questions to weave in:**
- Q8: "Who do you know who's already living the future you just described?"
- Q9: "What identity would you have to give up to change?"
- Q10: "What's the real reason you haven't changed? The one that sounds weak?"

**Then flip to vision:**
- Q11: "Forget practicality. What does your ideal Tuesday look like in 3 years?"

**Delivery:** Major pattern reveal + primary driver insight

**End state:** User experiences breakthrough dissonance

---

### Day 6: Anticipation (Urgency + Vision Building)

**Goal:** Channel dissonance into vision, create momentum

**Dan Koe questions to weave in:**
- Q12: "What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel natural?"
- Q13: "What's one thing you'd do this week if you were already that person?"
- Synthesis questions (evening protocol)

**Extraction targets:**
- Vision raw material
- Identity statements
- Immediate action possibilities

**End state:** User has vision draft, feels urgency to act

---

### Day 7: Conversion (Profile Reveal + Paywall)

**Goal:** Deliver full profile, present game model, convert

**Synthesis:**
- Show anti-vision (compressed sentence)
- Show vision (MVP statement)
- Show detected patterns
- Show primary driver
- Present: "Here's your game. Here's how you win."

**Dan Koe game model delivery:**
```
Your anti-vision: [what's at stake]
Your vision: [how you win]
Your 1-year goal: [the mission]
Your first project: [the boss fight]
Your daily levers: [the quests]
Your constraints: [the rules]
```

**Conversion prompt:** "Ready to start playing?"

**End state:** User converts or has complete profile to consider

---

## Open Questions for Exploration

### Content Questions
1. Which questions are essential vs nice-to-have?
2. How do we handle users who resist the anti-vision work?
3. What's the minimum viable breakthrough?

### Extraction Questions
4. How do we extract "anti-vision" from natural conversation?
5. What signals tell us the user has had their breakthrough moment?
6. How do we differentiate genuine insight from social desirability?

### Safety Questions
7. At what point does anti-vision work become harmful?
8. How do we handle users who uncover trauma?
9. What's our protocol for users who spiral during excavation?

### UX Questions
10. How long should each daily session be? (5 min? 15 min? Open-ended?)
11. Should users be able to skip days or is sequence critical?
12. What happens if a user doesn't complete the protocol in 7 days?

---

## Next Exploration Steps

1. **Prototype Day 3 conversation** - Test pattern revelation approach
2. **Map questions to signals** - What does each question extract?
3. **Design safety rails** - When to pause, when to escalate to resources
4. **Test anti-vision intensity** - User research on emotional tolerance
