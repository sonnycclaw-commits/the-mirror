# 7-Day Cliff — Ideation Canvas

**Problem (Old):** ~~Users invest 7 days of psychological discomfort (anti-vision excavation) before receiving tangible value (Birth Chart).~~

**Problem (Reframed):** The 7-day experience was framed as "work." It should be framed as "conversation." The Birth Chart should feel like a *surprise reveal* of what TARS noticed — not a reward for completing tasks.

**Insight:** Spotify Wrapped works because users just listen to music. The reveal is surprising because they didn't know they were generating data. S.T.A.R.S. should work the same way.

## The Core Reframe

```
OLD FRAMING                        NEW FRAMING (Wrapped-Style)
──────────────                     ────────────────────────────
"Complete 7 days of excavation"    "Talk to TARS for 7 days"
"Answer anti-vision questions"     "Have a conversation"
"Earn your Birth Chart"            "Discover what TARS noticed"
Quiz → Reward                      Conversation → Surprise Reveal
```

**The key shift:** User doesn't feel like they're building the Birth Chart. They feel like TARS is watching, learning, noticing — and Day 7 is when TARS shows them what it saw.

## Passive Signal Extraction (The Math Behind Wrapped)

TARS silently captures 5 signal types during conversation:

| Signal Type | Captured From | Example Reveal |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **STATED** | Goals, fears, beliefs in words | "You said 'family first' 4 times" |
| **EMOTIONAL** | Sentiment, markers ("but...", "I can't...") | "Resistance appears when you mention money" |
| **TEMPORAL** | Response time, hesitation, session timing | "You pause longest on relationship questions" |
| **RELATIONAL** | People mentioned, sentiment toward them | "Partner mentioned 12 times, avg sentiment -0.3" |
| **BEHAVIORAL** | Topics skipped, deflections | "You avoided the career question twice" |

**Pattern Detection (Granger Causality):**
After 3+ observations, TARS detects sequences:
> "Every time you mention [person], your response time on the next question increases. There's a connection there."

## Industry Patterns

### 🟢 Duolingo: Delay Commitment, Early Value

| Pattern | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Delay signup** | User completes first lesson BEFORE creating account |
| **Instant win** | First translation feels easy → "I can do this!" |
| **Streak from Day 1** | Loss aversion kicks in immediately |
| **XP and badges** | Variable rewards throughout |
| **Streak freeze** | Forgiveness for life getting in the way |
| **Progress bar** | Visual momentum |

**Insight:** Duolingo shows you CAN learn before asking you to commit.

### 🟢 Self-Help Books: Dopamine Trap + Social Accountability

| Pattern | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Chapter 1 revelation** | "Most people skip Chapter 1 — you won't" |
| **Story-driven** | Narrative arc, not just theory |
| **Author's journey** | "I was like you, then..." creates trust |
| **Exercises interleaved** | Action after insight |
| **Reading groups** | Social accountability |
| **Highlighting/notes** | User investment creates sunk cost |

**Why books still fail:** No feedback loop. No personalization. No accountability.

### 🟢 Onboarding Psychology: Sunk Cost + Variable Rewards

| Pattern | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Small early investments** | Profile photo, preferences → feels like "mine" |
| **User-generated content** | Answers create ownership |
| **Variable rewards** | Unpredictable dopamine hits |
| **Progress indicators** | "20% complete" feels like you've started |
| **Core value in onboarding** | Show the payoff before asking for commitment |
| **Skip option** | Autonomy prevents resentment |

### � Spotify Wrapped: THE MODEL for Birth Chart

| Pattern | How It Works | S.T.A.R.S. Equivalent |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Zero effort** | Users just listen to music | Users just talk to TARS |
| **Passive data collection** | Spotify tracks plays silently | TARS extracts nodes silently |
| **Surprise reveal** | Year-end "Here's what you listened to" | Day 7 "Here's what I noticed" |
| **Social currency** | Shareable, identity-affirming | Birth Chart as shareable artifact |
| **Scarcity** | Once per year | One-time reveal (ritualizable?) |

**Why Wrapped works:** Users forgot they were generating data. The reveal feels like a gift, not a reward.

## Candidate Solutions (Wide)

---

### Category 2: Sunk Cost / Investment

| Idea | Description | When |

| **First Star Ceremony** | Animate first star appearing → "This is yours" | Day 1 |
| **Daily Artifact** | Each day produces something visible (a quote, a star, a pattern) | Daily |
| **Voice Recording** | Record an answer → emotional investment | Day 3 |
| **Photo Upload** | "Upload a photo from your anti-vision week" | Day 5 |

---

### Category 3: Social Proof / Community

| **Daily Stars** | Some stars visible each day, full constellation Day 7 | Less drama |
| **Sprint Mirror** | 30-minute intensive session (all in one day) | Loss of reflection |

---

### Category 5: Communicate Value Upfront

| Idea | Description | When |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Example Birth Chart** | "This is Alex. Here's what they discovered." | Day 0 |
| **Video Testimonial** | Real user describing their "There I am" moment | Day 0 |

---

### Category 7: Gamification (Use Sparingly)

| Idea | Description | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|
| **7-Day Streak** | Visual streak with freeze option | Streak anxiety |
| **XP for Sessions** | Points per completed session | Feels transactional |
| **Achievement Badges** | "Brave Explorer" for Day 3 | May feel trivial |
| **Leaderboard** | "Your constellation is in top 20% for depth" | Comparison anxiety |

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Pure gamification** | Makes psychological depth feel like a game |
| **Nagging notifications** | Creates resentment, not engagement |
| **"You're falling behind"** | Shame → avoidance → churn |
| **Information overload** | Cognitive fatigue → abandonment |
| **Promising too much** | Overhype → disappointment at reveal |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Can we show value on Day 1?** What's the smallest "win" that proves S.T.A.R.S. sees you?
2. **Is 7 days sacred?** What if some users need 4 days, others 10?
3. **Does the constellation form in public or private?** Social sharing before vs after reveal?
4. **What's the analogy?** Ultrasound? Polaroid developing? Telescope focusing?
5. **What creates sunk cost without manipulation?** Genuine investment vs artificial friction?

## Promising Combinations

### Combo A: Preview-First
- Day 0: Show example Birth Chart ("This is what's coming")
- Day 1: First star appears immediately after first session
- Day 3: 30% of constellation visible, rest blurred
- Day 5: Dark star teased
- Day 7: Full reveal

### Combo B: Daily Stars
- Each day, one star appears based on that day's excavation
- By Day 7, all 7+ stars are visible
- Birth Chart is the CONNECTIONS revealing, not the stars themselves
- Stars without connections = Scattered phase

### Combo C: Sprint + Slow
- Day 1: 30-minute intensive → first 3 stars appear
- Days 2-6: One question per day (low friction)
- Day 7: Deep synthesis session → full constellation
- Tradeoff: Less psychological depth mid-week

### Combo D: Social Proof-First
- Day 0: "Join 10,000 people who discovered their Birth Chart"
- Day 1: Match with anonymous journey partner
- Daily: "Your partner completed Day 3. You're on Day 2."
- Day 7: Compare Birth Charts (anonymous or named)

### ⭐ Combo E: Wrapped-Style (RECOMMENDED)
- **Framing:** "Talk to TARS for 7 days. On Day 7, discover what TARS noticed."
- **Day 1:** Conversation (not quiz). First star appears. TARS: "Something caught my eye."
- **Days 2-6:** Conversation continues. TARS drops observations:
  - "You mentioned [X] 3 times. That's not random."
  - "I'm noticing a pattern. We'll explore it on Day 7."
- **Day 7:** Full reveal — not as reward, but as *surprise gift*
  - "Here's what I've noticed about you..."
  - Patterns user didn't consciously provide
  - Granger causality reveals: "When [A], you [B]"

**Why this wins:**
- User doesn't feel like they're "doing work"
- Birth Chart feels like insight, not certificate
- TARS feels intelligent, not bureaucratic
- Matches the proven Spotify Wrapped psychology

*Combo E is the synthesis. The 7-day cliff dissolves when users don't know they're climbing it.*
